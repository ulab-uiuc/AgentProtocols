Vertigo can have various causes, such as inner ear issues, dehydration, or other medical conditions. It's good to note that the symptoms lessen when you're still, which is common with certain types of vertigo.\n\nFor now, try to stay hydrated and avoid sudden movements that might trigger the spinning sensation. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. They may suggest specific exercises or medications to help manage the symptoms.
