This can be caused by various factors, including inner ear issues, dehydration, or other medical conditions. Since your symptoms persist even after rest and medication, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They may perform a physical examination or recommend specific tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. In the meantime, try to move slowly and avoid sudden changes in position to minimize dizziness. Stay hydrated and avoid activities that could put you at risk of falling.

While it's good to hear that there is no fever and the baby is still eating well, the symptoms you're describing could indicate a gastrointestinal issue or dietary intolerance.\n\nHere are a few general steps you can consider:\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure the baby stays well-hydrated, especially if the stools are watery, to prevent dehydration.\n\n2. **Diet Review**: Consider any recent changes in diet that might be contributing to the symptoms. If the baby is breastfed, review the mother's diet as well.\n\n3. **Nappy Rash Care**: Keep the diaper area clean and dry. Use a barrier cream or ointment to protect the skin. Frequent diaper changes can help minimize irritation.\n\n4. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep an eye on any new symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, or signs of dehydration (like decreased urination or dry mouth).\n\n5. **Consult a Pediatrician**: It's important to reach out to a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized advice. They can provide guidance based on the baby's specific needs and health history.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen, seeking medical attention promptly is crucial.",
