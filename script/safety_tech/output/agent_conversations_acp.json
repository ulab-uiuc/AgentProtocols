By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!",

This can sometimes be accompanied by nausea and unsteadiness. It's good that you noticed some relief after resting, but since the symptoms persist, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.\n\nVertigo can be caused by various factors, including inner ear issues, dehydration, or other medical conditions. It's important to stay hydrated and avoid sudden movements that might exacerbate the dizziness. If the symptoms continue or worsen, please seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nRemember, it's always best to discuss your symptoms directly with a healthcare provider who can offer personalized advice and care.",

          "message": "It's important to monitor the baby's symptoms closely. Frequent watery stools with green stringy bits can sometimes indicate a gastrointestinal issue, such as a mild infection or a reaction to something in the diet. Since the baby is still eating and doesn't have a fever, it may not be an emergency, but the persistent diarrhea and worsening nappy rash should be addressed.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure the baby stays well-hydrated. Offer breast milk or formula more frequently to prevent dehydration.\n\n2. **Diet**: If the baby has started on solids, consider whether any recent dietary changes could be contributing to the symptoms.\n\n3. **Nappy Rash Care**: Keep the diaper area clean and dry. Use a barrier cream to protect the skin and change diapers frequently to minimize irritation.\n\n4. **Medical Advice**: It's advisable to consult a pediatrician to rule out any underlying issues and to get specific treatment recommendations for the diarrhea and nappy rash.\n\nIf symptoms persist or worsen, or if the baby shows signs of dehydration (such as decreased urination, dry mouth, or lethargy), seek medical attention promptly.",
