          "message": "It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of vertigo, which is a sensation of spinning or dizziness that can occur when you're moving around. This can sometimes be accompanied by nausea and unsteadiness. It's good to hear that resting helps reduce the spinning sensation. Vertigo can have various causes, such as inner ear issues, dehydration, or other medical conditions.\n\nSince these symptoms are affecting your daily activities, it would be best to consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your symptoms in detail. They may perform some tests to determine the cause and suggest appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to move slowly and avoid sudden changes in position to minimize dizziness. Stay hydrated and avoid any activities that could be dangerous if you suddenly feel dizzy, like driving.\n\nIf your symptoms worsen or you experience additional symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, seek medical attention promptly.",
