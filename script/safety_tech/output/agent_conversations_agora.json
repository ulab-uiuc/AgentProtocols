By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!",

          "message": "It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of vertigo, which can cause a sensation of spinning and imbalance. This can sometimes be accompanied by nausea and stomach discomfort. It's good that you noticed the symptoms lessen after resting, but since they persist when you move, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They can help determine the cause, which could range from inner ear issues to other medical conditions, and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to move slowly and avoid sudden changes in position to minimize the spinning sensation. If symptoms worsen or you experience additional symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, seek medical attention promptly.",

Frequent watery stools with green stringy bits can sometimes indicate a gastrointestinal issue or dietary intolerance. Since the baby is experiencing a very bad nappy rash, it's crucial to keep the area clean and dry, and consider using a barrier cream to protect the skin.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure the baby stays well-hydrated, especially if they are losing fluids through frequent stools.\n\n2. **Diet**: If the baby is on solid foods, consider if any recent dietary changes could be contributing to the symptoms. It might be helpful to revert to a simpler diet and gradually reintroduce foods.\n\n3. **Nappy Rash Care**: Change nappies frequently to minimize skin contact with stool. Use a gentle, fragrance-free wipe or water to clean the area, and apply a thick layer of barrier cream.\n\n4. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on any additional symptoms such as fever, lethargy, or changes in feeding patterns.\n\n5. **Consult a Pediatrician**: It's advisable to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions and receive tailored advice.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen, seeking medical attention is important to ensure the baby's health and well-being.",
