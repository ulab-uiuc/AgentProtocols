It's good to hear that the baby doesn't have a fever and is still eating well, but the change in stool frequency and consistency is worth monitoring.\n\nHere are a few general suggestions:\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure the baby stays well-hydrated, especially if they are losing fluids through frequent stools.\n\n2. **Diaper Rash Care**: Use a barrier cream or ointment to protect the skin from further irritation. Make sure to change diapers frequently and allow the baby's skin to air out when possible.\n\n3. **Diet**: If the baby is on solid foods, consider if any recent dietary changes could be contributing to the symptoms.\n\n4. **Monitor Symptoms**: Keep an eye on any additional symptoms such as changes in behavior, feeding, or the presence of blood in the stool.\n\n5. **Consult a Pediatrician**: It's important to reach out to a healthcare provider to discuss these symptoms in detail, especially since the frequency and nature of the stools have changed.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen, or if you have any concerns, please contact a healthcare professional for personalized advice.",
