          "message": "It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms that could be related to vertigo, which is a sensation of spinning or dizziness. This can sometimes be accompanied by nausea and unsteadiness. It's good to note that the symptoms lessen when you're still, which is common in certain types of vertigo.\n\nThere are a few potential causes for these symptoms, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), inner ear infections, or other vestibular disorders. The connection with stomach discomfort might be due to the nausea often associated with vertigo, but it's important to consider all symptoms together.\n\nI recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They can provide a proper diagnosis and suggest appropriate treatment options. In the meantime, try to move slowly and avoid sudden changes in position to minimize the dizziness. If your symptoms worsen or you experience additional symptoms like severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, seek medical attention promptly.",
