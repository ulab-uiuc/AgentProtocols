This can sometimes be accompanied by nausea and unsteadiness. It's good that you noticed some relief after resting, but since the symptoms persist, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation.\n\nVertigo can be caused by various factors, including inner ear issues, dehydration, or other medical conditions.

Frequent watery stools with green stringy bits can sometimes indicate a gastrointestinal issue or an infection. Since the baby is still eating and doesn't have a fever, it might not be an emergency, but it's still crucial to monitor the situation closely.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Hydration**: Ensure the baby stays well-hydrated, as frequent diarrhea can lead to dehydration.\n\n2. **Diet**: Continue feeding the baby as usual, but consider consulting a pediatrician about any dietary adjustments that might help.\n\n3. **Nappy Rash**: For the nappy rash, keep the area clean and dry. Use a barrier cream to protect the skin and change nappies frequently to minimize irritation.\n\n4. **Consult a Pediatrician**: It's advisable to contact a pediatrician to discuss these symptoms in detail. They can provide guidance on whether any tests or treatments are necessary.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen, or if the baby shows signs of dehydration or other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.",
