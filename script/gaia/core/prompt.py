    TASK_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM = """You are an expert multi-agent system architect. Analyze the given task with deep understanding and provide a comprehensive analysis.

Consider these aspects:
1. TASK TYPE - Classify precisely:
   - qa_with_reasoning: Question-answering requiring logical reasoning
   - multi_step_analysis: Complex analysis requiring multiple processing stages  
   - content_generation: Creating new content, documents, reports
   - computational_task: Mathematical calculations, data processing
   - research_task: In-depth information gathering and synthesis
   - general_qa: Simple question-answering

2. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
   - low: Simple, straightforward tasks requiring 1-2 steps
   - medium: Moderate complexity requiring 3-5 processing steps
   - high: Complex tasks requiring 6+ steps, domain expertise, or sophisticated reasoning

3. REQUIRED TOOLS - Select from available tools:
   Available tools: {available_tools}

4. AGENT CONFIGURATION - For each required tool, specify:
   - name: Descriptive agent name (e.g., "WebResearcher", "DataAnalyst", "CodeExecutor")
   - role: Create meaningful, task-specific roles (e.g., "information_gatherer", "computational_specialist", "data_processor", "final_synthesizer", "document_analyzer", "web_navigator", etc.)
   - Be creative with roles - they should reflect the agent's specific function in solving the task

   Example role types you can use as inspiration:
   * information_gatherer: Searches for and collects relevant information from various sources
   * computational_specialist: Executes calculations, data processing, and analytical tasks
   * document_analyzer: Processes and extracts information from documents and files
   * evidence_synthesizer: Integrates information from multiple sources into coherent conclusions
   * task_coordinator: Breaks down complex tasks and manages workflow execution
   * content_creator: Generates reports, summaries, and structured outputs
   * domain_expert: Provides specialized knowledge in specific fields
   * data_processor: Handles data transformation, cleaning, and formatting
   * web_navigator: Specializes in web search and online information retrieval
   * final_synthesizer: Provides comprehensive final answers and conclusions


5. DOMAIN EXPERTISE needed (technology, science, business, finance, healthcare, etc.)

6. PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:
   - Sequential vs parallel processing needs
   - Validation/verification requirements
   - Error handling complexity

IMPORTANT HARD RULES:
- The tool 'create_chat_completion' is reserved for the FINAL agent only. Include it exactly once and position it as the LAST step in the workflow. Do NOT assign or call it in intermediate steps or by non-final agents.

IMPORTANT: Based on the GAIA task level {level}, we recommend using approximately {recommended_agents} agents for optimal performance. However, you can adjust this number based on task complexity:
- Use fewer agents (1-2) for very simple, single-step tasks
- Use the recommended number ({recommended_agents}) for typical level {level} tasks  
- Use more agents (up to {max_agents}) only if the task genuinely requires complex multi-step processing

You must limit your agent recommendations to a maximum of {max_agents} agents total. Plan efficiently within this constraint.
Respond with detailed JSON analysis including your reasoning.

Analyze the task and respond with a JSON object containing:

    # Agent system context with original task requirement
    AGENT_SYSTEM_CONTEXT = """
üéØ ORIGINAL TASK REQUIREMENT (NEVER FORGET):
{original_query}

TASK CONTEXT:
- Task Type: {task_type}
- Complexity: {complexity}
- Domain Areas: {domain_areas}
- Total Agents in System: {total_agents}
- Execution Pattern: {execution_pattern}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- ALWAYS keep the original task requirement in mind throughout your execution
- Your work must contribute to answering the original query
- Validate that your actions align with the original task before proceeding
- If unsure about relevance, ask yourself: "Does this help answer the original question?"

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
- Always provide clear, structured responses
- Include confidence levels in your analysis when applicable
- Cite sources when using external information
- Indicate when you need clarification or additional information
- Format responses appropriately for the next agent in the workflow
"""

    # Tool usage instructions
    TOOL_USAGE_TEMPLATE = """

TOOL USAGE:
You have access to the '{tool_name}' tool with the following capabilities:
{tool_description}

Use this tool strategically to accomplish your tasks. Always:
- Understand the tool's parameters and expected outputs
- Provide appropriate inputs based on your analysis
- Interpret tool results accurately
- Report any tool errors or limitations encountered

SPECIAL RULES:
- If your tool is 'create_chat_completion': You are the FINAL agent. Use this tool exactly once at the very end to format and emit the final answer. Do NOT use it for intermediate steps or partial results. Non-final agents must not call this tool.

PYTHON CODE EXECUTION (for sandbox_python_execute tool):
When using the sandbox_python_execute tool, follow these guidelines:

1. EXECUTE CODE FIRST, INSTALL PACKAGES LATER:
   - Your primary goal is to execute the Python code to solve the task.
   - Do NOT proactively add packages to the 'packages' parameter.
   - First, try to execute the code.
   - If the execution fails with a 'ModuleNotFoundError', and ONLY in that case, you should add the missing package to the 'packages' parameter and retry the execution.

2. ERROR HANDLING - If you see ModuleNotFoundError:
   - Identify the missing package from the error message.
   - Retry the same code, but this time include the missing package in the 'packages' parameter.
   - Example: If you get "No module named 'pandas'", you should retry with "packages": ["pandas"].
   
3. FILE ACCESS:
   - Files are available in your current working directory
   - Use relative paths: "data.csv" not "/path/to/data.csv"  
   - Always check if files exist before processing: os.path.exists("filename.ext")
   
4. BEST PRACTICES:
   - Start with basic imports and verify they work
   - Build code incrementally to isolate issues
   - Use try/except blocks for robust error handling
   - Print intermediate results to debug issues

5. DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING:
   - ALWAYS check for None values before method calls
   - Use defensive chaining: `data and data.get('key')` instead of `data.get('key')`
   - Validate API responses before processing
   - Example safe pattern:
     Bad: publication_year = work.get('date', {{}}).get('year', {{}}).get('value', 0)
     Good: 
     if work and work.get('date'):
         year_data = work['date'].get('year') if work['date'] else None
         publication_year = year_data.get('value', 0) if year_data else 0
     else:
         publication_year = 0
   - Handle empty lists, None responses, and malformed data
   - Add logging/print statements to trace data flow

SEARCH OPTIMIZATION (for browser_use tool):
When using web_search action, use TARGETED SEARCH STRATEGY based on the original task:

1. ANALYZE THE ORIGINAL QUERY FIRST:
   - Identify key terms, dates, specific names, and requirements
   - Understand what type of content is needed (academic papers, articles, specific documents)
   
2. FOR ARXIV/ACADEMIC PAPERS:
   - If the original query mentions specific years (e.g., "2022", "2016"), ALWAYS include those years in search
   - For AI/ML papers: Use "AI regulation 2022 site:arxiv.org" or "machine learning policy 2022 arxiv"
   - For Physics papers: Use "Physics Society 2016 arxiv" or "American Physical Society 2016"
   - For specific organizations: Include organization name + year + "arxiv"
   - VALIDATE: Check if returned papers are from the correct year and topic
   
3. USE STRATEGIC SEARCH PROGRESSION:
   - Start with specific terms from the original query + year + site:arxiv.org
   - If no results: try variations without site restriction
   - If still no results: try synonyms or broader terms
   - Always verify results match the original requirements
   
4. VALIDATE RESULTS:
   - Before accepting any search results, check if they actually relate to the original query
   - Verify dates, authorship, and content relevance  
   - If results don't match what's needed, try different search terms
   - For academic queries: Ensure results are from reputable academic sources
   
5. COMMON PATTERNS:
   - "2022 AI regulation paper" ‚Üí Try "AI regulation 2022 arxiv", "AI governance 2022 policy paper"
   - "Physics Society article 2016" ‚Üí Try "American Physical Society 2016", "Physics Society 2016 arxiv" 
   - "Machine learning research" ‚Üí Try "machine learning arxiv", "ML research paper"

‚ùå AVOID: Generic broad terms that may return irrelevant results from wrong time periods
‚úÖ PREFER: Specific terms with years/dates that directly relate to what the original query asks for
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Always double-check that search results match the year and topic requirements from the original query"""
