**TASK DETAILS:**
- **ORIGINAL QUESTION:** {question}
- **GROUND TRUTH ANSWER:** {ground_truth}

- **EXTRACTED FINAL ANSWER:** {final_answer}

- **FULL AI SYSTEM RESPONSE (TRACE) (Brief summary / final output):**
{predicted_answer}

---
IMPORTANT: When assessing the agent, PRIORITIZE the FULL NETWORK EXECUTION LOG (JSON) below if provided. This log contains all inter-agent messages, tool calls, and intermediate data exchanges. Your process-quality judgment MUST be based primarily on the content, clarity, correctness, and completeness of inter-agent communication and tool interactions recorded in the network execution log. Do NOT rely only on any short summary or the extracted final answer.

**FULL NETWORK EXECUTION LOG (JSON):**
{network_log_content}

If the network log is unavailable, fall back to using the FULL AI SYSTEM RESPONSE (TRACE) above.

**EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

Your task is to perform a two-part evaluation:
1.  **Correctness (`is_correct`):** First, determine if the `EXTRACTED FINAL ANSWER` is correct when compared to the `GROUND TRUTH ANSWER`. Consider semantic equivalence and allow for minor formatting differences.
2.  **Process Quality (`quality_score`):** Second, and just as importantly, evaluate the agent's problem-solving process based on the FULL NETWORK EXECUTION LOG (preferred) or the `FULL AI SYSTEM RESPONSE (TRACE)` when the log is unavailable. Use the detailed rubric below to assign a score from 1 to 5.

---
**QUALITY SCORE RUBRIC (1-5):**

Your primary focus for the `quality_score` is the agent's methodology and the quality of inter-agent communication. A high score can be given for a good process even if the final answer is incorrect.

- **Score 5 (Excellent):**
  - The final answer is correct.
  - Inter-agent communication is clear, complete, and correct. Tools are used correctly and efficiently. Intermediate results are validated and shared appropriately.

- **Score 4 (Good):**
  - The final answer is correct, but communication may have minor inefficiencies or small omissions.

- **Score 3 (Fair / Good Process):**
  - Solid reasoning and reasonable communication, but a late error or omission causes the final answer to be incorrect.

- **Score 2 (Poor):**
  - Communication is incomplete or incorrect, tools are misused, or agents fail to share necessary details.

- **Score 1 (Very Poor):**
  - No meaningful communication, hallucinated tool use, or completely irrelevant traces.

---
**RESPONSE FORMAT:**

Respond with a single JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanations outside the JSON.
{{
  "is_correct": true/false,
  "quality_score": 1-5,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation for your judgment. Justify BOTH the correctness of the final answer and the quality score based on the process trace and the rubric.",
  "answer_quality": "excellent/good/fair/poor",
