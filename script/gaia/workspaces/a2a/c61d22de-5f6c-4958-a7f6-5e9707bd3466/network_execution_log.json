We develop careful mis-specification tests specifically designed to blend the above model selection criterion with the ability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the environment. We recover the model selection guarantees of the CORRAL algorithm for adversarial environments, but with the additional benefit of achieving high probability regret bounds, specifically in the case of nested adversarial linear bandits. More importantly, our model selection results also hold simultaneously in stochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are the first theoretical results that achieve best of both world (stochastic and adversarial) guarantees while performing model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n\n\n| Comments: | 10 pages in main, 43 pages appendix |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2206.14912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912) [cs.LG] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2206.14912v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912v1) [cs.LG] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14912>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Aldo Pacchiano [[view email](/show-email/7e8a94b7/2206.14912)]   \n **[v1]**\nWed, 29 Jun 2022 20:57:30 UTC (69 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Best of Both Worlds Model Selection, by Aldo Pacchiano and 2 other authors* [View PDF](/pdf/2206.14912v1)\n* [TeX Source](/src/2206.14912v1)\n* [Other Formats](/format/2206.14912v1)\n\n[..."

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n\n| Comments: | 23 pages, 8 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.03637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.03637v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Renato Vicente [[view email](/sho...\nStep 2 (FigureAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'AI regulation June 2022 arXiv.org figure three axes':\n\n1.

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n\n| Comments: | 23 pages, 8 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.03637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.03637v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Renato Vicente [[view email](/sho...\nStep 2 (FigureAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'AI regulation June 2022 arXiv.org figure three axes':\n\n1.

Lottery winners claimed land in the order in which their names were drawn, so the draw number is an approximate rank ordering of lottery wealth. This mechanism allows for the estimation of a dose-response function, which relates each draw number to the expected outcome under each draw. I estimate dose-response functions...\n\n3.

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n\n| Comments: | 23 pages, 8 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.03637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.03637v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Renato Vicente [[view email](/sho...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n\n| Comments: | 23 pages, 8 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.03637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.03637v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Renato Vicente [[view email](/sho...\nStep 2 (FigureAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'AI regulation June 2022 arXiv.org figure three axes':\n\n1.

We model a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation constraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with encephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have been driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian structures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back to hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The dynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian phase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts for modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate hierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In harsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in small groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model permits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record (Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can be clearly seen.\n\n\n| Comments: | 23 pages, 8 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.03637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.03637v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03637v1) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.03637>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Renato Vicente [[view email](/sho...\nStep 2 (FigureAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'AI regulation June 2022 arXiv.org figure three axes':\n\n1.

These are the first theoretical results that achieve best of both world (stochastic and adversarial) guarantees while performing model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n\n\n| Comments: | 10 pages in main, 43 pages appendix |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2206.14912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912) [cs.LG] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2206.14912v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912v1) [cs.LG] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14912>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Aldo Pacchiano [[view email](/show-email/7e8a94b7/2206.14912)]   \n **[v1]**\nWed, 29 Jun 2022 20:57:30 UTC (69 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Best of Both Worlds Model Selection, by Aldo Pacchiano and 2 other authors* [View PDF](/pdf/2206.14912v1)\n* [TeX Source](/src/2206.14912v1)\n* [Other Formats](/format/2206.14912v1)\n\n[...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

The relevant papers have been located:\n\n1. **AI Regulation Paper (June 2022)**: The identified paper titled \"Best of Both Worlds Model Selection\" does not directly concern AI regulation in a societal context, thus it is unlikely to contain figures with societal axis labels. Therefore, investigation into this paper for such figure labels seems misplaced.\n\n2. **Physics and Society Article (August 2016)**: The paper titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\" contains terms directly related to societal structures, namely \"hierarchical\" and \"egalitarian.\"\n\nGiven the mismatch in locating the exact AI regulation paper with the specified figure, we must focus on the terms relating to societal types from the Physics and Society article.\n\nThe terms \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical\" are therefore potential candidates for societal descriptions, with \"egalitarian\" being more aligned with modern AI ethical discussions, suggesting balance and equality.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Egalitarian"
