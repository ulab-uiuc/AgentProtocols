These communities may overlap or have intricate internal structure. Extracting communities with particular topological structure, even when they overlap with other communities, is a powerful capability that would provide novel avenues of focusing in on structure of interest. In this work we consider extracting highly-cyclic regions of directed graphs (digraphs).
