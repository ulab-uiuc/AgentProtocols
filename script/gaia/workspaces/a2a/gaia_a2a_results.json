        "reasoning": "The extracted final answer is incorrect as it states that the average number of pre-2020 works could not be calculated, whereas the ground truth answer is 26.4. The process quality is fair because the AI system correctly identified the task and attempted to access the ORCID pages using the provided IDs. However, it encountered issues with JavaScript support and search errors, which prevented successful data retrieval. The inter-agent communication was clear, and the steps were logically followed, but the inability to handle JavaScript-dependent pages and the lack of a fallback strategy led to an incorrect final answer.",
