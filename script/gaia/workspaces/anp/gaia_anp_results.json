The AI system was unable to access the necessary data due to a limitation in handling JavaScript on ORCID pages, which prevented it from calculating the average number of pre-2020 works. The process quality is rated as 3 because the AI system correctly identified the task, extracted ORCID IDs, and attempted to access the necessary data. However, it failed to achieve the final goal due to technical limitations. The communication was clear and the steps were logical, but the inability to handle JavaScript was a critical oversight that led to an incorrect final answer.",
