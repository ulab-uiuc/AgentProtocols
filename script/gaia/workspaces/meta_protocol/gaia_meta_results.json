        "reasoning": "The extracted final answer is incorrect as it does not provide a numerical value for the average number of pre-2020 works, which is expected to be 26.4 according to the ground truth. The process quality is very poor because the network execution log shows repeated fallback messages without any meaningful progress or communication between agents. There is no evidence of tool usage or data processing that could lead to a correct answer. The agents failed to extract or utilize any ORCID identifiers from the file, which was crucial for completing the task. The final answer is not present in a meaningful form, and there is no partial credit as the task was not advanced in any significant way.",
