      "question": "I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.",

      "predicted_answer": "You were researching invasive species, specifically a fish popularized by the movie \"Finding Nemo,\" known as the clown anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris). You wanted to know where this fish was found as a nonnative species according to the USGS, before 2020, formatted as zip codes. The USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database was identified as the key resource for tracking occurrence data of non-native species in the U.S. However, specific zip codes were not directly provided in the search results, and accessing detailed location data would require using the query functions on the USGS website.",
