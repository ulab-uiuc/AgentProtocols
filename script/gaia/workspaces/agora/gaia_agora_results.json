In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",

The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?",

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize?

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",
