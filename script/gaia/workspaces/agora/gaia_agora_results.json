The file contained ORCID IDs for several researchers. Attempts were made to access these ORCID pages to gather the necessary data, but the process encountered technical difficulties due to the limitations of a headless server environment, which prevented proper interaction with the ORCID website. Consequently, the average number of pre-2020 works could not be calculated.",

The process quality is poor because the AI system failed to access the necessary data due to technical limitations in a headless server environment. The inter-agent communication was incomplete, and the tools were not used effectively to overcome the technical challenges. The agents did not share necessary details or find alternative methods to access the required information, leading to an inability to calculate the average.",
