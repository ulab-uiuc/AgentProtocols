      "question": "A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?",
      "ground_truth": "egalitarian",
      "predicted_answer": "The task was to identify a word from a figure in a June 2022 AI regulation paper on arXiv, which is also used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016. The June 2022 paper, titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values,\" features three axes labeled: (i) Standardization vs. Localization, (ii) Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and (iii) Consequential vs. Deontological. The August 2016 Physics and Society article, titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical,\" uses the word \"Egalitarian\" to describe a type of society. Therefore, \"Egalitarian\" is the word that appears in both contexts.",

        "reasoning": "The AI system's response correctly identifies 'Egalitarian' as the word used to describe a type of society in both the June 2022 AI regulation paper and the August 2016 Physics and Society article. The response provides a detailed explanation of the context in which 'Egalitarian' is used in both papers, demonstrating a proper understanding of the question. The extracted final answer matches the ground truth answer, and the response is factually correct and complete. The AI system's answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, and it addresses the question comprehensively.",
