The search for the 2016 article led to \"Detecting highly cyclic structure with complex eigenpairs,\" which did not contain relevant societal terms. The search for the June 2022 AI regulation paper led to \"Best of Both Worlds Model Selection,\" but the specific figure with axes labels was not found. Therefore, the task remains incomplete as the specific word linking both articles was not identified.",
