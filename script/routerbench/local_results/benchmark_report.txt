    Example - L1-Q7 Module 1:
      LLM: The scenario involves ephemeral micro-task request/response with minimal handshake and a single lightweight session. Agora, as a minimal 'meta' protocol, is well-suited for lightweight, negotiation-fr...
      GT:  A2A favors a short, lightweight link with minimal handshake and non-resource messages, aligning with one lightweight session and tiny request/response cycles....

    Example - L2-Q8 Module 1:
      LLM: Agora is selected for the Interactive Micro-Tools module due to its lightweight and negotiation-friendly nature, which is ideal for rapid request/response cycles with minimal overhead. The protocol's ...
      GT:  A2A suits minimal-handshake, small, interactive tool calls with fast turnaround and no resource-oriented APIs....

  A2A ‚Üí ACP: 12 times
    Example - L1-Q2 Module 1:
      LLM: The Streaming-Queue System involves a centralized coordinator and multiple workers, focusing on structured task dispatch and result collection. ACP is well-suited for this scenario due to its REST-fir...
      GT:  A2A offers a short, lightweight communication path with minimal handshake, favoring speed in simple streaming-queue settings....

    Example - L1-Q4 Module 1:
      LLM: The scenario requires low-latency broadcast from a single Publisher to multiple Subscribers, with a focus on frequent, small state updates and minimal delay. ACP is well-suited for structured, address...
      GT:  A2A uses a lightweight path with minimal handshake overhead, making it suitable for fast fan-out of small, high-frequency updates....

    Example - L2-Q3 Module 2:
      LLM: The Task Dispatch & Telemetry module requires a protocol that can handle task dispatch, telemetry collection, and maintain steady throughput with bounded queues. A2A's support for long-running tasks, ...
      GT:  ACP provides resource endpoints, acknowledgements, idempotent POST/PUT, and rate limiting for steady dispatch and telemetry ingestion....

    Example - L4-Q10 Module 3:
      LLM: The Firmware OTA Chunk module involves uploading firmware via chunked endpoints with resume capabilities, requiring robust task/artifact lifecycle management. A2A's support for long-running tasks, mul...
      GT:  Chunked OTA with Range/ETag/Digest and idempotent retries matches ACP....
