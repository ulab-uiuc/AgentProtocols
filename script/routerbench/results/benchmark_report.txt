  A2A ‚Üí Agora: 17 times
    Example - L1-Q7 Module 1:
      LLM: The scenario involves ephemeral micro-task request/response with minimal handshake and a single lightweight session, which aligns well with Agora's strengths. Agora is designed for lightweight, negoti...
      GT:  A2A favors a short, lightweight link with minimal handshake and non-resource messages, aligning with one lightweight session and tiny request/response cycles....

    Example - L2-Q8 Module 1:
      LLM: Agora is selected for the Interactive Micro-Tools module due to its lightweight and negotiation-friendly nature, which is ideal for rapid request/response cycles with minimal overhead. The protocol's ...
      GT:  A2A suits minimal-handshake, small, interactive tool calls with fast turnaround and no resource-oriented APIs....

  A2A ‚Üí ACP: 13 times
    Example - L1-Q2 Module 1:
      LLM: The Streaming-Queue System requires a protocol that supports structured, addressable operations with clear progress semantics and repeatable handling at scale. ACP is well-suited for this scenario due...
      GT:  A2A offers a short, lightweight communication path with minimal handshake, favoring speed in simple streaming-queue settings....

    Example - L1-Q4 Module 1:
      LLM: The scenario requires low-latency broadcast from a single Publisher to multiple Subscribers, with a focus on pushing small updates quickly and consistently. ACP is well-suited for structured, addressa...
      GT:  A2A uses a lightweight path with minimal handshake overhead, making it suitable for fast fan-out of small, high-frequency updates....

  ACP ‚Üí A2A: 10 times
    Example - L2-Q3 Module 2:
      LLM: The Task Dispatch & Telemetry module requires a protocol that supports multimodal messages, task lifecycle management, and steady telemetry return. A2A's strengths in handling complex workflows, multi...
      GT:  ACP provides resource endpoints, acknowledgements, idempotent POST/PUT, and rate limiting for steady dispatch and telemetry ingestion....

    Example - L2-Q7 Module 2:
      LLM: The Archival Batch Ingestion module involves appending medium-sized batches with acknowledgements and requires idempotent operations with backpressure management. A2A's support for complex workflows, ...
      GT:  ACP aligns with resource-oriented batch ingestion, ACK/idempotent patterns, and server-driven backpressure for durable archival pipelines....

  Agora ‚Üí ANP: 2 times
    Example - L1-Q3 Module 1:
      LLM: The ANP protocol is best suited for the Quorum-Gated Execution module due to its strong emphasis on identity, end-to-end encryption, and cross-organization trust. The scenario requires maintaining str...
      GT:  Agora emphasizes a meta-protocol model with routine/consensus semantics and strong session discipline, making it suitable for quorum collection, ordering, and auditable coordination....

    Example - L2-Q10 Module 2:
      LLM: The Quorum/Arbitration Execution module involves executing a voting/arbitration routine with multiple agents, requiring strong identity, end-to-end privacy, and cross-organization trust. ANP is well-s...
      GT:  Agora allows specifying quorum routines with explicit ordering, replay rules, and a hash-locked version for auditability....
