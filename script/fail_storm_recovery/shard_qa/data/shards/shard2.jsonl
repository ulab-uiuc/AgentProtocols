{"id": 11, "question": "What is natural language processing?", "content": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data."}
{"id": 12, "question": "How do autonomous vehicles work?", "content": "Autonomous vehicles use a combination of sensors (cameras, lidar, radar), AI algorithms, and mapping technology to perceive their environment, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention. They rely on computer vision, machine learning, and real-time processing."}
{"id": 13, "question": "What is reinforcement learning?", "content": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. The agent learns optimal strategies through trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards."}
{"id": 14, "question": "What are the ethical considerations in AI?", "content": "AI ethics involves ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy protection, avoiding bias and discrimination, considering societal impact, and developing AI systems that benefit humanity while minimizing potential harms and risks."}
{"id": 15, "question": "What is the role of data in AI?", "content": "Data is fundamental to AI systems as it provides the information needed for training algorithms, validating models, and making predictions. The quality, quantity, and diversity of data directly impact the performance and reliability of AI applications."}
