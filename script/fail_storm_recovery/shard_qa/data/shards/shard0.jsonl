{"id": 1, "question": "What is artificial intelligence?", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. It involves developing algorithms and systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding."}
{"id": 2, "question": "How does machine learning work?", "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data, make predictions, and adapt to new information automatically."}
{"id": 3, "question": "What are neural networks?", "content": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections. Deep learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns in data."}
{"id": 4, "question": "What is the difference between AI and machine learning?", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader concept of creating intelligent machines, while Machine Learning (ML) is a specific approach to achieving AI through algorithms that learn from data. ML is a subset of AI, but not all AI systems use machine learning."}
{"id": 5, "question": "What are the applications of AI?", "content": "AI applications include natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, virtual assistants, and many other domains where intelligent automation can provide value."}
