      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to other parts of the cell. When proteins and lipids arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), they enter the cis face of the Golgi. Here, enzymes add or remove sugars, creating glycoproteins and glycolipids tailored for specific functions. The modified molecules then move through the Golgi's cisternae, where further modifications occur. At the trans face, the Golgi sorts these molecules into vesicles destined for various locations. Some vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents outside the cell, while others are directed to lysosomes or other organelles. This process ensures that each protein and lipid is correctly modified and delivered to its proper destination, maintaining cellular function and communication.",

      "answer": "Eating a vegetarian diet offers numerous health benefits. It is typically rich in dietary fiber, vitamins C and E, magnesium, folic acid, and antioxidants like carotenoids and flavonoids. This diet can lower the risk of heart disease by reducing cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Vegetarians often have a lower body mass index (BMI), which helps prevent obesity and related conditions like type 2 diabetes. A plant-based diet also reduces the risk of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. Additionally, it may improve kidney function and decrease the incidence of gallstones and diverticulitis. The high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts provides essential nutrients that support overall health and longevity. However, vegetarians should ensure they get enough protein, iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are more commonly found in animal products.

The falls began forming about 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age when retreating glaciers exposed the Niagara Escarpment. Initially, the falls were located near the present-day Queenston-Lewiston Bridge. Over millennia, erosion caused by the continuous flow of water has gradually moved the falls upstream to their current location. This natural retreat has occurred at an average rate of about one meter per year. The falls continue to erode today, although human intervention, such as the diversion of water for hydroelectric power, has slowed this process.

      "worker": "Worker-4",
      "answer": "The Federal Reserve uses three primary monetary policy tools: open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements. Open market operations involve buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply; purchasing securities increases the money supply, while selling them decreases it. The discount rate is the interest rate charged on loans from the Fed to banks, affecting borrowing costs and thus the money supply. Lower rates encourage borrowing and spending. Reserve requirements dictate the amount of funds banks must hold in reserve, not lend out. Lowering these requirements increases the money available for lending, potentially stimulating economic growth. These tools help the Fed manage inflation, stabilize the economy, and achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.",

      "worker": "Worker-3",
      "answer": "Maria Theresa, the Habsburg empress, implemented several reforms benefiting serfs in her territories during the 18th century. In 1749, she introduced the \"General Tax Directory,\" which aimed to reduce serfdom's burden by taxing landlords more heavily and limiting their ability to demand excessive labor from serfs. This measure was part of her broader goal to increase state revenue and stabilize the economy.\n\nIn 1767, she enacted the \"Serfdom Patent,\" which further regulated the relationship between landlords and serfs. It prohibited the sale of serfs without land, reduced labor obligations, and set limits on punishments. These reforms were significant steps towards improving serfs' legal status and living conditions, though they fell short of abolishing serfdom entirely. Maria Theresa's actions laid groundwork for later, more radical reforms that would eventually lead to the abolition of serfdom in Austria-Hungary.",

      "answer": "The pistil, the female reproductive part of a flower, consists of three main components: the stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is the receptive surface at the top where pollen grains land. It's often sticky to help capture pollen. Below the stigma is the style, a stalk-like structure that connects the stigma to the ovary. The length of the style can vary among different plant species. The ovary, located at the base of the pistil, contains ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. These parts work together to facilitate pollination and seed production. In some flowers, multiple pistils may fuse together, forming a compound pistil, while in others, they remain separate. The structure and arrangement of these parts can influence the type of pollinators attracted to the flower.",
