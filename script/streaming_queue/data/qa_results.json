She introduced the Robot Patent in 1771, which aimed to regulate and limit the amount of labor that serfs were required to provide to their landlords. This reform sought to reduce the burden on serfs by capping the number of days they had to work for their lords and ensuring they had more time to work on their own land. Additionally, she promoted agricultural reforms and sought to improve the overall welfare of the peasantry, although her measures were more conservative compared to those of her son, Joseph II, who later enacted more radical changes.
