      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids received from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies lipid molecules, and sorts them into vesicles. These vesicles are then directed to their appropriate destinations, such as the cell membrane for secretion, lysosomes, or other parts of the cell. The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and delivered to their functional locations within or outside the cell.",

MDs practice allopathic medicine, which focuses on diagnosing and treating diseases primarily through medication and surgery. DOs practice osteopathic medicine, which includes a holistic approach and emphasizes the body's musculoskeletal system, preventive care, and the body's ability to heal itself. DOs receive additional training in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), a hands-on technique to diagnose and treat various conditions.
