It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies lipids, and sorts them for transport to their destinations. The Golgi apparatus also packages these molecules into vesicles, which are then directed to various locations within the cell, such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or for secretion outside the cell.",

It originated from the 19th-century Hamitic hypothesis, which suggested that a subgroup of Caucasians, the Hamites, were responsible for any advanced culture in Africa. This theory was based on linguistic and racial assumptions that have since been debunked.
