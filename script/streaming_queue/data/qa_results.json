Once proteins and lipids arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus processes them by adding carbohydrate groups (glycosylation) or other modifications. It then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles. These vesicles are directed to various locations, such as the cell membrane for secretion, lysosomes for digestion, or other parts of the cell where they are needed. The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and delivered to their proper destinations.",
