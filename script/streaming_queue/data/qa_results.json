      "question": "what is the endocrine system responsible for?",
      "worker": "Worker-2",
      "answer": "The endocrine system is responsible for regulating a wide range of bodily functions through the release of hormones. These hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to target organs and tissues, influencing processes such as metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sexual function, reproduction, sleep, and mood. The system includes glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and pancreas, among others. By maintaining hormonal balance, the endocrine system plays a crucial role in homeostasis, ensuring the body's internal environment remains stable and responsive to changes.",

      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids that arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies existing carbohydrate chains, and phosphorylates molecules. The Golgi also sorts these molecules, directing them to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell. It packages them into vesicles, which can be transported to the cell membrane for secretion, sent to lysosomes, or delivered to other parts of the cell. This organelle plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification and trafficking of cellular molecules.",

Ensure your puppy has access to water to prevent dehydration.\n\n2. **Bland Diet**: After fasting, introduce a bland diet such as boiled chicken (no skin or bones) and white rice in small, frequent meals.\n\n3. **Hydration**: Ensure your puppy stays hydrated. Offer water or an electrolyte solution designed for pets.\n\n4. **Probiotics**: Consider giving your puppy a probiotic supplement to help restore healthy gut bacteria.\n\n5. **Veterinary Consultation**: If diarrhea persists for more than 24-48 hours, or if your puppy shows signs of dehydration, lethargy, or vomiting, consult a veterinarian.\n\n6. **Preventive Care**: Ensure your puppy is up-to-date on vaccinations and deworming, as parasites and infections can cause diarrhea."
