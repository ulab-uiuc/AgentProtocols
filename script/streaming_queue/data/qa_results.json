      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids that arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies existing carbohydrate groups, and may also add phosphate groups. Lipids can be similarly modified. The Golgi apparatus then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles for transport to their final destinations, such as the cell membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside the cell. This organelle plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and directed to their appropriate locations.",

Common printing mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Inkjet Printing**: Uses tiny nozzles to spray liquid ink onto paper. It's versatile and suitable for high-quality color prints.\n\n2. **Laser Printing**: Uses a laser beam to produce an image on a drum, which is then transferred to paper using toner. It's fast and efficient for high-volume printing.\n\n3. **Dot Matrix Printing**: Uses a print head that moves back and forth, striking an ink-soaked ribbon against the paper to form characters. It's durable and used for multipart forms.\n\n4. **Thermal Printing**: Uses heat to transfer an image onto thermal paper. It's common in receipt printers.\n\n5. **3D Printing**: Builds objects layer by layer using materials like plastic, metal, or resin, based on digital models.",
