      "question": "what does the golgi apparatus do to the proteins and lipids once they arrive ?",
      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in processing and modifying proteins and lipids once they arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here's what it does:\n\n1. **Modification**: The Golgi apparatus modifies proteins and lipids through processes such as glycosylation, where sugars are added to them. This modification is essential for proper functioning and stability.\n\n2. **Sorting**: It sorts the modified proteins and lipids and determines their destination. This involves packaging them into vesicles that transport them to different locations within or outside the cell.\n\n3. **Secretion**: For proteins destined for secretion, the Golgi apparatus packages them into secretory vesicles that will fuse with the cell membrane, releasing their content outside the cell.\n\n4. **Transportation**: The Golgi apparatus also sends proteins and lipids to lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or other organelles, depending on their specific functions.\n\nOverall, the Golgi apparatus is vital for the post-translational modification and proper distribution of proteins and lipids within the cell.",

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it described groups in North and East Africa, especially those speaking Afro-Asiatic languages. This classification often implied a racial hierarchy, suggesting Hamitic peoples were superior to other groups, such as the \"Bantu.\" However, modern scholarship has rejected the term due to its oversimplified and misleading nature. Today, researchers focus on specific ethnic groups and their histories without using this outdated classification.",
