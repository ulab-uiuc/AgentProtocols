      "question": "what does the golgi apparatus do to the proteins and lipids once they arrive ?",
      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids received from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies lipid molecules, and sorts them into vesicles. These vesicles are then directed to their appropriate destinations, such as the cell membrane for secretion, lysosomes, or other parts of the cell. The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and delivered to their functional locations.",

      "question": "what is abbreviated dialing",
      "worker": "Worker-2",
      "answer": "Abbreviated dialing is a telecommunication feature that allows users to dial a short sequence of numbers to reach a specific phone number or service, instead of dialing the full number. This is often used for speed dialing, where users can assign frequently called numbers to a single digit or a few digits. It simplifies the process of making calls, especially for numbers that are dialed often. Abbreviated dialing is commonly used in both personal and business phone systems.",

      "answer": "The Federal Reserve (the Fed) uses three primary monetary policy tools to manage the economy:\n\n1. **Open Market Operations (OMO):** This involves the buying and selling of government securities in the open market to influence the level of reserves in the banking system, thereby affecting interest rates and the supply of money.\n\n2. **Discount Rate:** This is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from the Federal Reserve's discount window. Adjusting the discount rate influences the cost of borrowing and the level of reserves banks hold.\n\n3. **Reserve Requirements:** This tool involves setting the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold against deposits. Changing reserve requirements can directly impact the amount of money banks can lend, influencing the money supply and economic activity.",

      "answer": "Maria Theresa, the Habsburg Empress, implemented several reforms to improve the conditions of serfs in her dominions. She introduced the Robot Patent in 1771, which aimed to regulate and limit the amount of labor that serfs were required to provide to their landlords. This reform sought to reduce the burden on serfs by capping the number of days they had to work for their lords and ensuring they had time to work on their own land. Additionally, she promoted agricultural reforms and education, which indirectly benefited the serfs by improving their living conditions and opportunities. However, her reforms were limited and did not abolish serfdom entirely, leaving significant power in the hands of the nobility.",
