      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids that arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies lipid molecules, and ensures proper folding and functionality. The Golgi apparatus then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles for transport to their final destinations, such as the cell membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside the cell. This organelle plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification and trafficking of cellular molecules.",

Adjusting the discount rate influences the cost of borrowing and the level of reserves banks hold.\n\n3. **Reserve Requirements:** This tool involves setting the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold against deposits. Changing reserve requirements can directly impact the amount of money banks can lend, influencing the money supply and economic activity.",

She introduced the Robot Patent in 1771, which aimed to regulate and limit the amount of labor that serfs were required to provide to their landlords. This reform sought to reduce the burden on serfs by capping the number of days they had to work for their lords and ensuring they had more time to work on their own land. Additionally, she promoted agricultural improvements and education, which indirectly benefited the serfs by enhancing their productivity and living conditions. However, her reforms were limited and did not abolish serfdom entirely, leaving significant power in the hands of the nobility.",
