      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids received from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies lipid molecules, and sorts them into vesicles. These vesicles are then directed to their appropriate destinations, such as the cell membrane for secretion, lysosomes, or other parts of the cell. The Golgi apparatus plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and delivered to their functional locations.",

Then, introduce a bland diet such as boiled chicken and rice in small, frequent meals.\n\n3. **Probiotics**: Consider giving your puppy a probiotic supplement designed for dogs to help restore healthy gut bacteria.\n\n4. **Veterinary Consultation**: If diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours, or if your puppy shows signs of distress, lethargy, or vomiting, consult a veterinarian. Puppies can quickly become dehydrated and may need medical attention.\n\n5. **Avoid Human Medications**: Do not give your puppy over-the-counter human medications without veterinary guidance.\n\nAlways monitor your puppy's condition closely and seek professional advice if needed.",
