      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus is a vital cell organelle that processes and modifies proteins and lipids received from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here are its main functions:\n\n1. **Sorting and Shipping**: It sorts proteins and lipids, directing them to various parts of the cell or for export outside the cell.\n\n2. **Post-Translational Modifications**: Proteins undergo modifications like glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation, which are essential for their functions.\n\n3. **Packaging into Vesicles**: The Golgi apparatus packages the modified proteins and lipids into vesicles. These vesicles transport the molecules to their destinations, such as lysosomes, the cell membrane, or for secretion outside the cell.\n\nIn summary, the Golgi apparatus serves as a processing and packaging center, ensuring proteins and lipids are correctly modified and sent to their appropriate locations.",

They may use osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) for pain relief and overall health.\n\n2. **Training and Education**:\n   - Both complete four years of medical school, but DOs receive additional training in the musculoskeletal system and OMT.\n   - Both must complete residency programs, pass licensing exams, and are fully licensed to practice medicine.\n\n3. **Specialization and Practice**:\n   - Both can specialize in any medical field, though DOs are often found in primary care roles.\n\nOverall, both MDs and DOs are qualified physicians with similar responsibilities, differing mainly in their training philosophies and treatment methods."
