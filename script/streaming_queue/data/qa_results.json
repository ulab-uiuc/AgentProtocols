Common printing mechanisms include:\n\n1. **Inkjet Printing**: Uses tiny nozzles to spray liquid ink onto paper. It's versatile and suitable for high-quality color prints.\n\n2. **Laser Printing**: Uses a laser beam to produce an image on a drum, which is then transferred to paper using toner. It's fast and efficient for high-volume printing.\n\n3. **Dot Matrix Printing**: Uses a print head that moves back and forth, striking an ink-soaked ribbon against the paper to form characters. It's durable and used for multipart forms.\n\n4. **Thermal Printing**: Uses heat to transfer an image onto thermal paper.
