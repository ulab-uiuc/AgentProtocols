      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus is essential for processing proteins and lipids after they are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It performs three main functions:\n\n1. **Modification**: The Golgi apparatus chemically alters proteins and lipids through processes like glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are crucial for their functionality and targeting.\n\n2. **Sorting**: It sorts the modified molecules, directing them to their correct destinations within the cell, such as the cell membrane, other organelles, or for secretion outside the cell.\n\n3. **Packaging**: The Golgi packages the modified proteins and lipids into vesicles, facilitating their transport to various cellular locations, thus playing a vital role in cellular communication and metabolism.\n\nOverall, the Golgi apparatus ensures that proteins and lipids are properly modified, sorted, and delivered to their intended sites, maintaining cellular efficiency and function.",

          "text": "To change the IP address on a Netgear router, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Connect to your router**: Use either Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable.\n2. **Log in to the router’s web interface**: Open a web browser and enter the router's IP address (commonly `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`).\n3. **Enter your login credentials**: Use the default username `admin` and password `password`, unless you've changed these.\n4. **Navigate to the LAN settings**: Look for `LAN Setup` or `Network Settings`, typically found under the `Advanced` tab.\n5. **Change the IP address**: Modify the `IP Address` field, ensuring it stays within the same subnet. For example, if your current router IP is `192.168.1.1`, you might change it to `192.168.1.2`.\n6. **Save the changes**: Click the `Apply` or `Save` button to confirm your new settings.\n7. **Reconnect**: You may need to reconnect to the network using the new IP address.\n8. **Restart the router (if necessary)**: Some changes may require the router to be restarted.\n\nBe sure to update the settings on connected devices as needed!"
