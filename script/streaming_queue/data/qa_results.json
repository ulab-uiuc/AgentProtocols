These hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to target organs and tissues, influencing processes such as metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sexual function, reproduction, sleep, and mood. The system includes glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and pancreas, among others. By maintaining hormonal balance, the endocrine system plays a crucial role in homeostasis, ensuring the body's internal environment remains stable and responsive to changes.",
