It is less sensitive than MRI but can still detect larger metastases.\n\n3. **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography):** Sometimes used in conjunction with CT or MRI to assess metabolic activity and help differentiate between tumor types.\n\nThese studies help in diagnosing, planning treatment, and monitoring the response to therapy.",
