      "question": "what does the golgi apparatus do to the proteins and lipids once they arrive ?",
      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids that arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies existing carbohydrate groups, and adds phosphate groups. Lipids may also be modified by the addition of carbohydrate groups to form glycolipids. The Golgi apparatus then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles for transport to their final destinations, such as the cell membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside the cell. This organelle plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and directed to their appropriate locations.",
