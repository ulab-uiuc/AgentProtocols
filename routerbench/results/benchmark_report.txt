‚ùå Error Analysis:
  A2A ‚Üí ACP: 10 times
    Example - L1-Q2 Module 1:
      LLM: ACP is well-suited for structured, addressable operations with clear progress semantics and repeatable handling at scale, which aligns with the centralized streaming-queue network's need for efficient...
      GT:  A2A offers a short, lightweight communication path with minimal handshake, favoring speed in simple streaming-queue settings....

    Example - L1-Q4 Module 1:
      LLM: ACP is well-suited for scenarios requiring low-latency broadcast and consistent update delivery due to its REST-first approach, which supports structured, addressable operations with clear progress se...
      GT:  A2A uses a lightweight path with minimal handshake overhead, making it suitable for fast fan-out of small, high-frequency updates....

  A2A ‚Üí Agora: 9 times
    Example - L1-Q7 Module 1:
      LLM: Agora is well-suited for scenarios requiring minimal handshake and lightweight session management. Its meta-protocol nature allows for fast protocol evolution and heterogeneity tolerance, which is ide...
      GT:  A2A favors a short, lightweight link with minimal handshake and non-resource messages, aligning with one lightweight session and tiny request/response cycles....

    Example - L2-Q7 Module 1:
      LLM: Agora is well-suited for the Low-Latency Alert Push module due to its lightweight and negotiation-friendly nature, which is ideal for pushing small, frequent alert messages with minimal handshake. The...
      GT:  A2A fits lightweight, minimal-handshake alert fan-out with steady cadence and low latency, avoiding resource/state-machine overheads....

  ACP ‚Üí A2A: 5 times
    Example - L5-Q1 Module 3:
      LLM: A2A is suitable for massive dataset transfers as it supports long-running tasks and complex workflows with its HTTP + JSON-RPC + SSE transport model. It provides task/artifact lifecycle management, wh...
      GT:  Chunked transfer with resume/integrity and server-side flow control aligns with large dataset movement....

    Example - L5-Q2 Module 3:
      LLM: A2A is suitable for ETL archival tasks that require batch appending with acknowledgements and observable status. Its support for long-running tasks and task/artifact lifecycle management helps in hand...
      GT:  Batch append benefits from idempotent writes, status codes, and server-driven backpressure....
