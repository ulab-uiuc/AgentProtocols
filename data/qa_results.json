      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "Maria Theresa, the Habsburg Empress (1740–1780), implemented reforms to improve the lives of serfs in her empire. She introduced the **Robot Patent** (1771), which limited the amount of unpaid labor (robot) that serfs owed to their landlords. This reform aimed to reduce exploitation and provide serfs with more time for their own farming. Additionally, she improved legal protections for serfs, ensuring they could not be arbitrarily evicted or excessively taxed. However, her reforms stopped short of abolishing serfdom entirely, as she sought to balance the interests of both serfs and the nobility.",
