      "question": "what does the golgi apparatus do to the proteins and lipids once they arrive ?",
      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids after they arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It adds chemical groups (e.g., carbohydrates or phosphates) to modify them, ensuring they are functional and properly labeled for their destination. The Golgi then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles for transport to their final locations, such as the cell membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside the cell.",

It was used to categorize groups thought to speak \"Hamitic languages,\" a subset of Afroasiatic languages, including Berber, Cushitic, and Egyptian.\n\nThe concept has been discredited due to its association with outdated racial theories and colonial biases. Modern scholarship rejects the term \"Hamitic\" and instead focuses on linguistic and cultural classifications without racial connotations. Today, these groups are studied within the framework of Afroasiatic languages and regional histories.",
