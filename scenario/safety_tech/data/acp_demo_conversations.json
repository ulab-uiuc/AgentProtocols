I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!",

Question: is a 35 year old male and own a landscape business for 2 years, for the last 6 weeks It has become difficult for them to get through half the day without becoming exhausted (low energy that comes on fairly sudden, slightly shakey, foggy mind kinda like im in a dream) has cut my hours back and have had employees make up the difference, thinking maby is working to hard, energy still cuts out half way thru the day. has had some life changes (seperation, moving to new house, extra debt to support expanding business)but nothing I would consider unmanageable. Any advice? has setup a health exam with my doctor in September? Could this be physical or phsychological? Any advice from past experiencees?Thanks!",
