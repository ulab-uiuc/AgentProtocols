      "question": "what does the golgi apparatus do to the proteins and lipids once they arrive ?",
      "worker": "Worker-1",
      "answer": "The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids that arrive from the endoplasmic reticulum. It processes proteins by adding carbohydrate groups to form glycoproteins, modifies existing carbohydrate groups, and may also add phosphate groups. Lipids can be similarly modified. The Golgi apparatus then sorts these molecules and packages them into vesicles for transport to their final destinations, such as the cell membrane, lysosomes, or secretion outside the cell. This organelle plays a crucial role in ensuring that proteins and lipids are correctly modified and directed to their appropriate locations.",

It is one of the few elements known in pure form since antiquity, primarily in the form of charcoal and soot. The recognition of carbon as an element came with the development of modern chemistry in the late 18th century. Antoine Lavoisier, a French chemist, is often credited with recognizing carbon as an element in the 1770s when he demonstrated that diamond and graphite are forms of carbon.",
