In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20..."

In this paper, we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size.

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20..."

In addition to increasing Higgs invisible decay through mixing, the Majoron can generally have flavor-changing interactions with fermions. We find that type-III seesaw model poses such interesting properties with both charged leptons and neutrinos. This opens up new channels to search for the Majoron.

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

On the scaling laws of crime and the inadequacy of per capita rankings -- a cross-country study, by Marcos Oliveira\n[View PDF](/pdf/2012.15368v2)\n> Abstract:Crime rates per capita are used virtually everywhere to rank and compare cities. However, their usage relies on a strong linear assumption that crime increases at the same pace as the number of people in a region. In this paper, we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size. We analyze the population-crime relationship in cities across 12 countries and assess the impact of per capita measurements on crime analyses, depending on the type of offense. In most countries, we find that theft increases superlinearly with population size, whereas burglary increases linearly. Our results reveal that per capita rankings can differ from population-adjusted rankings such that they disagree in approximately half of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the data analysed here. Hence, we advise caution when using crime rates per capita to rank cities and recommend evaluating the linear plausibility before doing so.\n\n\n| Comments: | 21 pages, 5 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Applications (stat.AP) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2012.15368v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368v2) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.15368>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8>  Focus to learn more   DOI(s) linking to related resources |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Marcos Oliveira [[view email](/show-email/a5850e0e/2012.15368)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2012.15368v1)**\nWed, 30 Dec 2020 23:36:28 UTC (687 KB)  \n\n**[v2]**\nMon, 2 Aug 2021 13:52:10 UTC (691 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nVie..."

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20...\nStep 2 (NatureResearcher - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Chinstrap penguin global population Nature.com 2020':\n\n1.

On the scaling laws of crime and the inadequacy of per capita rankings -- a cross-country study, by Marcos Oliveira\n[View PDF](/pdf/2012.15368v2)\n> Abstract:Crime rates per capita are used virtually everywhere to rank and compare cities. However, their usage relies on a strong linear assumption that crime increases at the same pace as the number of people in a region. In this paper, we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size. We analyze the population-crime relationship in cities across 12 countries and assess the impact of per capita measurements on crime analyses, depending on the type of offense. In most countries, we find that theft increases superlinearly with population size, whereas burglary increases linearly. Our results reveal that per capita rankings can differ from population-adjusted rankings such that they disagree in approximately half of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the data analysed here. Hence, we advise caution when using crime rates per capita to rank cities and recommend evaluating the linear plausibility before doing so.\n\n\n| Comments: | 21 pages, 5 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Applications (stat.AP) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2012.15368v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368v2) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.15368>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8>  Focus to learn more   DOI(s) linking to related resources |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Marcos Oliveira [[view email](/show-email/a5850e0e/2012.15368)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2012.15368v1)**\nWed, 30 Dec 2020 23:36:28 UTC (687 KB)  \n\n**[v2]**\nMon, 2 Aug 2021 13:52:10 UTC (691 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nVie...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20..."

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20..."

In addition to increasing Higgs invisible decay through mixing, the Majoron can generally have flavor-changing interactions with fermions. We find that type-III seesaw model poses such interesting properties with both charged leptons and neutrinos. This opens up new channels to search for the Majoron.

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

On the scaling laws of crime and the inadequacy of per capita rankings -- a cross-country study, by Marcos Oliveira\n[View PDF](/pdf/2012.15368v2)\n> Abstract:Crime rates per capita are used virtually everywhere to rank and compare cities. However, their usage relies on a strong linear assumption that crime increases at the same pace as the number of people in a region. In this paper, we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size. We analyze the population-crime relationship in cities across 12 countries and assess the impact of per capita measurements on crime analyses, depending on the type of offense. In most countries, we find that theft increases superlinearly with population size, whereas burglary increases linearly. Our results reveal that per capita rankings can differ from population-adjusted rankings such that they disagree in approximately half of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the data analysed here. Hence, we advise caution when using crime rates per capita to rank cities and recommend evaluating the linear plausibility before doing so.\n\n\n| Comments: | 21 pages, 5 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Applications (stat.AP) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2012.15368v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368v2) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.15368>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8>  Focus to learn more   DOI(s) linking to related resources |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Marcos Oliveira [[view email](/show-email/a5850e0e/2012.15368)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2012.15368v1)**\nWed, 30 Dec 2020 23:36:28 UTC (687 KB)  \n\n**[v2]**\nMon, 2 Aug 2021 13:52:10 UTC (691 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nVie..."

However, fully automated registration of such long-range pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult; and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair. Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15343) [cs.CV] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:20...\nStep 2 (NatureResearcher - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Chinstrap penguin global population Nature.com 2020':\n\n1.

On the scaling laws of crime and the inadequacy of per capita rankings -- a cross-country study, by Marcos Oliveira\n[View PDF](/pdf/2012.15368v2)\n> Abstract:Crime rates per capita are used virtually everywhere to rank and compare cities. However, their usage relies on a strong linear assumption that crime increases at the same pace as the number of people in a region. In this paper, we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size. We analyze the population-crime relationship in cities across 12 countries and assess the impact of per capita measurements on crime analyses, depending on the type of offense. In most countries, we find that theft increases superlinearly with population size, whereas burglary increases linearly. Our results reveal that per capita rankings can differ from population-adjusted rankings such that they disagree in approximately half of the top 10 most dangerous cities in the data analysed here. Hence, we advise caution when using crime rates per capita to rank cities and recommend evaluating the linear plausibility before doing so.\n\n\n| Comments: | 21 pages, 5 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Applications (stat.AP) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2012.15368](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368) [physics.soc-ph] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2012.15368v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15368v2) [physics.soc-ph] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2012.15368>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8>  Focus to learn more   DOI(s) linking to related resources |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Marcos Oliveira [[view email](/show-email/a5850e0e/2012.15368)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2012.15368v1)**\nWed, 30 Dec 2020 23:36:28 UTC (687 KB)  \n\n**[v2]**\nMon, 2 Aug 2021 13:52:10 UTC (691 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nVie...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"
