I'll initiate a search that focuses on PubChem with these specific characteristics.\nStep 5 (WeightComparator - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `sandbox_python_execute` executed:\nError: Sandbox execution failed after 4 attempts: Sandbox not initialized\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

However, due to the limitations and errors encountered during data retrieval and processing in previous steps, we were unable to obtain the necessary data directly. As a result, the final answer could not be concluded accurately.\n\nRecommendation: To successfully complete this task, I suggest accessing the PubChem database directly via reliable means, either through published APIs or by downloading the relevant dataset and performing the required transformations and comparisons manually. This approach will help overcome the technical barriers faced during the tool executions in this session."
