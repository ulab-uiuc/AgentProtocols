Techniques that operate on a per-link basis are deemed quite effective, but proper operation requires that the two end points involved in the communication agree on the channels to be used for transmission. On the contrary, communication in the network can be prevented, eventually leading, in the worst cases, to the disconnection of part of the nodes. This paper presents CONSIP, a technique aimed to ensure strict consistency in the information exchanged between the nodes and used to drive communication, by preventing a prior the aforementioned problem from occurring. Results show a slight increase in energy consumption, due to the use of a backup cell, whereas communication latency does not worsen. The effectiveness of CONSIP was assessed by means of an experimental campaign, and the only drawback we found is that the backup cell, which is required to be reserved per link, may limit the number of nodes in dense networks.\n\n\n| Comments: | preprint, 8 pages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2301.00070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070) [cs.NI] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2301.00070v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070v1) [cs.NI] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.00070>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Journal reference: | IEEE 18th International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2022), 2022, pp. 1-8 |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1109/WF...\nStep 2 (DataAnalyst - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'ScienceDirect 2022 Reference Works Life Science Health Sciences statistics':\n\n1.

In subsequent work with Kleinberg and Szegedy, they connected this to the search for combinatorial objects called strong uniquely solvable puzzles (strong USPs). We begin a systematic computer-aided search for these objects. We develop and implement constraint-based algorithms build on reductions to $\\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\\mathrm{IP}$ to verify that puzzles are strong USPs, and to search for large strong USPs. We produce tight bounds on the maximum size of a strong USP for width $k \\le 5$, construct puzzles of small width that are larger than previous work, and improve the upper bounds on strong USP size for $k \\le 12$. Although our work only deals with puzzles of small-constant width, the strong USPs we find imply matrix multiplication algorithms that run in $O(n^\\omega)$ time with exponent $\\omega \\le 2.66$. While our algorithms do not beat the fastest algorithms, our work provides evidence and, perhaps, a path to finding families of strong USPs that imply matrix multiplication algorithms that are more efficient than those currently known.\n\n\n| Comments: | 35 pages, 7 figures, full version of SAT 2020 extended abstract |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Symbolic Computation (cs.SC) |\n| ACM classes: | F.2.1; I.2.8; G.4; I.3.2 |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2301.00074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00074) [cs.CC] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2301.00074v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00074v1) [cs.CC] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.00074>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Matthew Anderson [[view email](/show-email/fdde1ba8/2301.00074)]   \n **[v1]**\nFri, 30 Dec 2022 23:53:51 UTC (2,427 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-----------...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

Techniques that operate on a per-link basis are deemed quite effective, but proper operation requires that the two end points involved in the communication agree on the channels to be used for transmission. On the contrary, communication in the network can be prevented, eventually leading, in the worst cases, to the disconnection of part of the nodes. This paper presents CONSIP, a technique aimed to ensure strict consistency in the information exchanged between the nodes and used to drive communication, by preventing a prior the aforementioned problem from occurring. Results show a slight increase in energy consumption, due to the use of a backup cell, whereas communication latency does not worsen. The effectiveness of CONSIP was assessed by means of an experimental campaign, and the only drawback we found is that the backup cell, which is required to be reserved per link, may limit the number of nodes in dense networks.\n\n\n| Comments: | preprint, 8 pages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2301.00070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070) [cs.NI] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2301.00070v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070v1) [cs.NI] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.00070>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Journal reference: | IEEE 18th International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2022), 2022, pp. 1-8 |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1109/WF...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

Techniques that operate on a per-link basis are deemed quite effective, but proper operation requires that the two end points involved in the communication agree on the channels to be used for transmission. On the contrary, communication in the network can be prevented, eventually leading, in the worst cases, to the disconnection of part of the nodes. This paper presents CONSIP, a technique aimed to ensure strict consistency in the information exchanged between the nodes and used to drive communication, by preventing a prior the aforementioned problem from occurring. Results show a slight increase in energy consumption, due to the use of a backup cell, whereas communication latency does not worsen. The effectiveness of CONSIP was assessed by means of an experimental campaign, and the only drawback we found is that the backup cell, which is required to be reserved per link, may limit the number of nodes in dense networks.\n\n\n| Comments: | preprint, 8 pages |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2301.00070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070) [cs.NI] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2301.00070v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00070v1) [cs.NI] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.00070>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Journal reference: | IEEE 18th International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2022), 2022, pp. 1-8 |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1109/WF...\nStep 2 (DataAnalyst - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'ScienceDirect 2022 Reference Works Life Science Health Sciences statistics':\n\n1.

However, reordering is expensive to measure, because each packet must be processed relative to the TCP sequence number of its predecessor in the same flow. Due to the volume of traffic, detection should take place in the data plane as the packets fly by. However, restrictions on the memory size and the number of memory accesses per packet make it impossible to design an efficient algorithm for pinpointing flows wi...\n\n3.

We develop and implement constraint-based algorithms build on reductions to $\\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\\mathrm{IP}$ to verify that puzzles are strong USPs, and to search for large strong USPs. We produce tight bounds on the maximum size of a strong USP for width $k \\le 5$, construct puzzles of small width that are larger than previous work, and improve the upper bounds on strong USP size for $k \\le 12$. Although our work only deals with puzzles of small-constant width, the strong USPs we find imply matrix multiplication algorithms that run in $O(n^\\omega)$ time with exponent $\\omega \\le 2.66$.
