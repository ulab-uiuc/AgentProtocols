Then, I will need to find out which of these standards have been superseded by newer versions as of August 2023.\n\nHere is how I plan to proceed:\n\n1. **Research the 1959 Standards**: Find the specific items in the \"dried and dehydrated section\" and those in the Frozen/Chilled section from the 1959 standards.\n2. **Identify Superseded Standards**: Determine which of these standards have been updated or superseded by a new version as of August 2023.\n\nI'll start by performing a web search to find the relevant 1959 standards and their current status. Let's begin with that.\nStep 2 (CurrentStandardsResearcher - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch results for '1959 USDA standards for dried and dehydrated fruits and vegetables':\n\n1.
