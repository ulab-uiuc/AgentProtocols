Abstract : Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global inform...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Conference:\nNeurIPS 2022 Conference | OpenReviewToggle navigation[**OpenReview**.net](/)\n\n* [Login](/login)\n√óLoading\n\n* [About OpenReview](/about)\n* [Hosting a Venue](/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support)\n* [All Venues](/venues)\n\n* [Contact](/contact)\n* [Sponsors](/sponsors)\n* [**Donate**](https://donate.stripe.com/eVqdR8fP48bK1R61fi0oM00)\n\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions)\n* [Terms of Use](/legal/terms)\n* [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)\n\n* [About OpenReview](/about)\n* [Hosting a Venue](/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support)\n* [All Venues](/venues)\n* [Sponsors](/sponsors)\n\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions)\n* [Contact](/contact)\n* [**Donate**](https://donate.stripe.com/eVqdR8fP48bK1R61fi0oM00)\n* [Terms of Use](/legal/terms)\n* [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)\n\n[OpenReview](/about) is a long-term project to advance science through improved peer review with legal nonprofit status.

Abstract : Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global inform...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Conference:\nNeurIPS 2022 Conference | OpenReviewToggle navigation[**OpenReview**.net](/)\n\n* [Login](/login)\n√óLoading\n\n* [About OpenReview](/about)\n* [Hosting a Venue](/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support)\n* [All Venues](/venues)\n\n* [Contact](/contact)\n* [Sponsors](/sponsors)\n* [**Donate**](https://donate.stripe.com/eVqdR8fP48bK1R61fi0oM00)\n\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions)\n* [Terms of Use](/legal/terms)\n* [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)\n\n* [About OpenReview](/about)\n* [Hosting a Venue](/group?id=OpenReview.net/Support)\n* [All Venues](/venues)\n* [Sponsors](/sponsors)\n\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.openreview.net/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions)\n* [Contact](/contact)\n* [**Donate**](https://donate.stripe.com/eVqdR8fP48bK1R61fi0oM00)\n* [Terms of Use](/legal/terms)\n* [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)\n\n[OpenReview](/about) is a long-term project to advance science through improved peer review with legal nonprofit status.
