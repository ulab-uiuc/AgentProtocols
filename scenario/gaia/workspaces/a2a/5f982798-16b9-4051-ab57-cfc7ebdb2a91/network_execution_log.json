The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of restoration steps on the quality of the restoration solution.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Systems and Control (eess.SY) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709) [eess.SY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16709v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709v3) [eess.SY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.16709>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Ogbonnaya Bassey [[view email](/show-email/5856ce4b/2103.16709)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2103.16709v1)**\nTue, 30 Mar 2021 22:30:58 UTC (1,135 KB)  \n\n**[[v2]](/abs/2103.16709v2)**\nThu, 1 Apr 2021 06:16:31 UTC (1,133 KB)  \n\n**[v3]**\nWed, 9 Mar 2022 05:04:50 UTC (1..."

The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid.

One promising approach to electricity restoration is the use of locally available energy resources to restore the system to form isolated microgrids. In this paper, we present a black start restoration method that forms islanded microgrids after a blackout. The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of restoration steps on the quality of the restoration solution.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Systems and Control (eess.SY) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709) [eess.SY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16709v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709v3) [eess.SY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.16709>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Ogbonnaya Bassey [[view email](/show-email/5856ce4b/2103.16709)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2103.16709v1)**\nTue, 30 Mar 2021 22:30:58 UTC (1,135 KB)  \n\n**[[v2]](/abs/2103.16709v2)**\nThu, 1 Apr 2021 06:16:31 UTC (1,133 KB)  \n\n**[v3]**\nWed, 9 Mar 2022 05:04:50 UTC (1...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

To face these demands, modulation schemes based on Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) can accommodate these requirements for wireless systems. On the other hand, several hybrid OFDM-based systems such as the Time-Interleaved Block Windowed Burst Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (TIBWB-OFDM) are capable of achieving even better spectral confinement and power efficiency. This paper addresses to the implementation of the TIBWB-OFDM system in a more realistic and practical wireless link scenarios by addressing the challenges of proper and reliable channel estimation and frame synchronization. We propose to incorporate a preamble formed by optimum correlation training sequences, such as the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The added ZC preamble sequence is used to jointly estimate the frame beginning, through signal correlation strategies and a threshold decision device, and acquire the channel state information (CSI), by employing estimators based on the preamble sequence and the transmitted data. The employed receiver estimators show that it is possible to detect the TIBWB-OFDM frame beginning and provide a close BER performance comparatively to the one where the perfect channel is known.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Signal Processing (eess.SP) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16719) [eess.SP] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16719v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16719v1) [eess.SP] for this version) |...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

One promising approach to electricity restoration is the use of locally available energy resources to restore the system to form isolated microgrids. In this paper, we present a black start restoration method that forms islanded microgrids after a blackout. The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of restoration steps on the quality of the restoration solution.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Systems and Control (eess.SY) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709) [eess.SY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16709v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709v3) [eess.SY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.16709>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Ogbonnaya Bassey [[view email](/show-email/5856ce4b/2103.16709)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2103.16709v1)**\nTue, 30 Mar 2021 22:30:58 UTC (1,135 KB)  \n\n**[[v2]](/abs/2103.16709v2)**\nThu, 1 Apr 2021 06:16:31 UTC (1,133 KB)  \n\n**[v3]**\nWed, 9 Mar 2022 05:04:50 UTC (1..."

There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other?

One promising approach to electricity restoration is the use of locally available energy resources to restore the system to form isolated microgrids. In this paper, we present a black start restoration method that forms islanded microgrids after a blackout. The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of restoration steps on the quality of the restoration solution.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Systems and Control (eess.SY) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709) [eess.SY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16709v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709v3) [eess.SY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.16709>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Ogbonnaya Bassey [[view email](/show-email/5856ce4b/2103.16709)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2103.16709v1)**\nTue, 30 Mar 2021 22:30:58 UTC (1,135 KB)  \n\n**[[v2]](/abs/2103.16709v2)**\nThu, 1 Apr 2021 06:16:31 UTC (1,133 KB)  \n\n**[v3]**\nWed, 9 Mar 2022 05:04:50 UTC (1..."

One promising approach to electricity restoration is the use of locally available energy resources to restore the system to form isolated microgrids. In this paper, we present a black start restoration method that forms islanded microgrids after a blackout. The master DGs in the formed microgrids are coordinated to work together through droop control. Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid. Studies were performed on a modified IEEE 123 node test feeder to evaluate the effects of demand response, non-dispatchable DGs, and choice of restoration steps on the quality of the restoration solution.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Systems and Control (eess.SY) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709) [eess.SY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16709v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16709v3) [eess.SY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2103.16709>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Ogbonnaya Bassey [[view email](/show-email/5856ce4b/2103.16709)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/2103.16709v1)**\nTue, 30 Mar 2021 22:30:58 UTC (1,135 KB)  \n\n**[[v2]](/abs/2103.16709v2)**\nThu, 1 Apr 2021 06:16:31 UTC (1,133 KB)  \n\n**[v3]**\nWed, 9 Mar 2022 05:04:50 UTC (1...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

This paper addresses to the implementation of the TIBWB-OFDM system in a more realistic and practical wireless link scenarios by addressing the challenges of proper and reliable channel estimation and frame synchronization.

Several constraints, including incentive-based demand response (DR) with direct load control (DLC) and distributed generator (DG) operation constraints, were formulated and linearized to realize a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) restoration model. To improve compactness and to ensure that the model is neither under-sized nor over-sized, a pre-processing graph analysis approach was introduced which helps to characterize the least number of restoration steps needed to optimally restore the microgrid.

To face these demands, modulation schemes based on Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) can accommodate these requirements for wireless systems. On the other hand, several hybrid OFDM-based systems such as the Time-Interleaved Block Windowed Burst Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (TIBWB-OFDM) are capable of achieving even better spectral confinement and power efficiency. This paper addresses to the implementation of the TIBWB-OFDM system in a more realistic and practical wireless link scenarios by addressing the challenges of proper and reliable channel estimation and frame synchronization. We propose to incorporate a preamble formed by optimum correlation training sequences, such as the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The added ZC preamble sequence is used to jointly estimate the frame beginning, through signal correlation strategies and a threshold decision device, and acquire the channel state information (CSI), by employing estimators based on the preamble sequence and the transmitted data. The employed receiver estimators show that it is possible to detect the TIBWB-OFDM frame beginning and provide a close BER performance comparatively to the one where the perfect channel is known.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Signal Processing (eess.SP) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2103.16719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16719) [eess.SP] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2103.16719v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16719v1) [eess.SP] for this version) |...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"
