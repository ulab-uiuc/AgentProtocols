They were part of the Apollo 12 mission.\n\nNext, I'll need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which the smaller astronaut belonged. Since Alan Bean was depicted as the smaller astronaut in the reflection, I'll need to identify his astronaut group and then find which astronaut from that group spent the least total time in space.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Alan Bean's Astronaut Group**: Find out which NASA astronaut group Alan Bean was a part of.\n2. **List Members of the Group**: Compile a list of astronauts from that group.\n3. **Determine Time Spent in Space**: For astronauts in that group who have flown, identify who spent the least time in space and calculate the total time in minutes.\n\nI'll start by finding Alan Bean's astronaut group using an online search.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.

They were part of the Apollo 12 mission.\n\nNext, I'll need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which the smaller astronaut belonged. Since Alan Bean was depicted as the smaller astronaut in the reflection, I'll need to identify his astronaut group and then find which astronaut from that group spent the least total time in space.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Alan Bean's Astronaut Group**: Find out which NASA astronaut group Alan Bean was a part of.\n2. **List Members of the Group**: Compile a list of astronauts from that group.\n3. **Determine Time Spent in Space**: For astronauts in that group who have flown, identify who spent the least time in space and calculate the total time in minutes.\n\nI'll start by finding Alan Bean's astronaut group using an online search.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.

They were part of the Apollo 12 mission.\n\nNext, I'll need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which the smaller astronaut belonged. Since Alan Bean was depicted as the smaller astronaut in the reflection, I'll need to identify his astronaut group and then find which astronaut from that group spent the least total time in space.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Alan Bean's Astronaut Group**: Find out which NASA astronaut group Alan Bean was a part of.\n2. **List Members of the Group**: Compile a list of astronauts from that group.\n3. **Determine Time Spent in Space**: For astronauts in that group who have flown, identify who spent the least time in space and calculate the total time in minutes.\n\nI'll start by finding Alan Bean's astronaut group using an online search.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.

They were part of the Apollo 12 mission.\n\nNext, I'll need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which the smaller astronaut belonged. Since Alan Bean was depicted as the smaller astronaut in the reflection, I'll need to identify his astronaut group and then find which astronaut from that group spent the least total time in space.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Alan Bean's Astronaut Group**: Find out which NASA astronaut group Alan Bean was a part of.\n2. **List Members of the Group**: Compile a list of astronauts from that group.\n3. **Determine Time Spent in Space**: For astronauts in that group who have flown, identify who spent the least time in space and calculate the total time in minutes.\n\nI'll start by finding Alan Bean's astronaut group using an online search.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.

They were part of the Apollo 12 mission.\n\nNext, I'll need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which the smaller astronaut belonged. Since Alan Bean was depicted as the smaller astronaut in the reflection, I'll need to identify his astronaut group and then find which astronaut from that group spent the least total time in space.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Identify Alan Bean's Astronaut Group**: Find out which NASA astronaut group Alan Bean was a part of.\n2. **List Members of the Group**: Compile a list of astronauts from that group.\n3. **Determine Time Spent in Space**: For astronauts in that group who have flown, identify who spent the least time in space and calculate the total time in minutes.\n\nI'll start by finding Alan Bean's astronaut group using an online search.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.
