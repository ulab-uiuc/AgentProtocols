Here is the plan:\n\n1. **Rubik's Cube Structure**: A standard Rubik's cube has 6 faces with each face of a specific color:\n   - There are 6 center pieces (one per face), each showing one color.\n   - There are 12 edge pieces (between center and corner on each face), each with two colors.\n   - There are 8 corner pieces (at the corners of each face), each with three colors.\n\n2. **Known Information**:\n   - All blue cubes have been found.\n   - All cubes surrounding the orange center cube have been identified.\n   - All green corners are found.\n   - All green cubes bordering yellow are found.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the cubes on the opposite face (typically red) are also found.\n\n3. **Missing Cube**: The missing cube has two colors. This implies it is an edge cube.\n\n4. **Analysis**: \n   - The orange center cube has its surrounding known, suggesting the orange face might lack other colors which are not covered by the opposites or adjacent faces already.\n   - The missing cube cannot have blue, as all blue cubes are found.\n   - The missing cube cannot be a green corner or bordering yellow from either side.\n   - The opposite of orange is red. Given the rule on finding opposites, any face opposite an orange edge must also be found.\n\n5. **Objective**: Determine the two colors on the missing cube.\n\nGiven the logical constraints, we need to check which colors complement the rule set when considering an edge cube. We shall simulate or list the possibilities.\n\n### Let's proceed with a logical script to help determine the missing colors.\n\nI will now write a Python script to simulate this process and logically deduce the missing cube colors."
