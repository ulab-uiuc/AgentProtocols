The decay of correlations in these systems, can be characterized and measured by correlation functions.

Different models, such as boosted decision trees (BDT) and artificial neural networks (ANN), are widely used in analyses and even in the software triggers. In most cases, these are classification models used to select the \"signal\" events from data. Monte Carlo simulated events typically take part in training of these models. While the results of the simulation are expected to be close to real data, in practical cases there is notable disagreement between simulated and observed data.

Our approach requires that each base learner comes with a candidate regret bound that may or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base learner according to a schedule that keeps the base learner's candidate regret bounds balanced until they are detected to violate their guarantees. We develop careful mis-specification tests specifically designed to blend the above model selection criterion with the ability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the environment. We recover the model selection guarantees of the CORRAL algorithm for adversarial environments, but with the additional benefit of achieving high probability regret bounds, specifically in the case of nested adversarial linear bandits. More importantly, our model selection results also hold simultaneously in stochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are the first theoretical results that achieve best of both world (stochastic and adversarial) guarantees while performing model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n\n\n| Comments: | 10 pages in main, 43 pages appendix |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2206.14912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912) [cs.LG] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2206.14912v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912v1) [cs.LG] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14912>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Aldo Pacchiano [[view email](/show-email/7e8a94b7/2206.14912)]   \n **[v1]**\nWed, 29 Jun 2022 20:57:30 UTC (69 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Best of Both Worlds Model Selection, by Aldo Pacchiano and 2 other authors* [View PDF](/pdf/2206.14912v1)\n* [TeX Source](/src/2206.14912v1)\n* [Other Formats](/format/2206.14912v1)\n\n[..."

In the context of symbolic dynamics of the non-chaotic multifractal attractors (i.e. Feigenbaum attractors), one observable, the symbol-to-symbol correlation function, for the generating partition of the logistic map, is rigorously introduced and checked with numerical experiments. Thanks to the Metropolis-Stein-Stein (MSS) algorithm this observable can be calculated analytically, giving predictions in absolute accordance with numerical computations. The deep, algorithmic structure of the observable is revealed clearly reflecting the complexity of the multifractal attractor.\n\n\n| Comments: | 15 pages, 2 figures |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1608.05876](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05876) [nlin.CD] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1608.05876v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05876v1) [nlin.CD] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.05876>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Simeon Mistakidis [[view email](/show-email/8c5e022e/1608.05876)]   \n **[v1]**\nSat, 20 Aug 2016 22:37:03 UTC (55 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Symbol-to-symbol correlation function at the Feigenbaum point of the logistic map, by K.

This is a novel Asynchronous Fair Adaptive Federated learning framework for stream-oriented IoT application environments, which are featured by time-varying operating conditions, heterogeneous resource-limited devices (i.e., coworkers), non-i.i.d. local training data and unreliable communication links.

The convergence properties of AFAFed under (possibly) non-convex loss functions is guaranteed by a set of new analytical bounds, which formally unveil the impact on the resulting AFAFed convergence rate of a number of Federated Learning (FL) parameters, like, first and second moments of the per-coworker number of consecutive model updates, data skewness, communication packet-loss probability, and maximum/minimum values of the (adaptively tuned) mixing coefficient used for model aggregation.\n\n\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2206.14927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14927) [cs.LG] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2206.14927v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14927v1) [cs.LG] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14927>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Michele Scarpiniti Prof. [[view email](/show-email/39a78689/2206.14927)]   \n **[v1]**\nWed, 29 Jun 2022 22:12:08 UTC (5,433 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled AFAFed -- Protocol analysis, by Enzo Baccarelli and 2 other authors* [View PDF](/pdf/2206.14927v1)\n* [TeX Source](/src/2206.14927v1)\n* [Other Formats](/format/2206.14927v1)\n\n[![license icon](https...\n\n⚠️  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"

Rogozhnikov View a PDF of the paper titled Reweighting with Boosted Decision Trees, by A. Rogozhnikov View PDF Abstract: Machine learning tools are commonly used in modern high energy physics (HEP) experiments. Different models, such as boosted decision trees (BDT) and artificial neural networks (ANN), are widely used in analyses and even in the software triggers. In most cases, these are classification models used to select the \"signal\" events from data. Monte Carlo simulated events typically take part in training of these models. While the results of the simulation are expected to be close to real data, in practical cases there is notable disagreement between simulated and observed data.

Our approach requires that each base learner comes with a candidate regret bound that may or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base learner according to a schedule that keeps the base learner's candidate regret bounds balanced until they are detected to violate their guarantees. We develop careful mis-specification tests specifically designed to blend the above model selection criterion with the ability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the environment. We recover the model selection guarantees of the CORRAL algorithm for adversarial environments, but with the additional benefit of achieving high probability regret bounds, specifically in the case of nested adversarial linear bandits. More importantly, our model selection results also hold simultaneously in stochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are the first theoretical results that achieve best of both world (stochastic and adversarial) guarantees while performing model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n\n\n| Comments: | 10 pages in main, 43 pages appendix |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (stat.ML) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2206.14912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912) [cs.LG] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2206.14912v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14912v1) [cs.LG] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.14912>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Aldo Pacchiano [[view email](/show-email/7e8a94b7/2206.14912)]   \n **[v1]**\nWed, 29 Jun 2022 20:57:30 UTC (69 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------------\n\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Best of Both Worlds Model Selection, by Aldo Pacchiano and 2 other authors* [View PDF](/pdf/2206.14912v1)\n* [TeX Source](/src/2206.14912v1)\n* [Other Formats](/format/2206.14912v1)\n\n[..."
