The chemical exchange involves spin jumps around different sites where the spin angular frequencies vary, which leads to a random phase walk viewed from the rotating frame reference. Therefore, the random walk in phase space can be treated by the effective phase diffusion method. Both the coupled and uncoupled phase diffusions are considered; additionally, it includes normal diffusion as well as fractional diffusion....\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00074v1:\n\n [2301.00074v1] Matrix Multiplication: Verifying Strong Uniquely Solvable Puzzles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[Skip to main content](#content)\n\n[![Cornell University](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, [member institutions](https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html), and all contributors.\n[Donate](https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html)\n\n\n[![arxiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-one-color-white.svg)](/) > [cs](/list/cs/recent) > arXiv:2301.00074v1\n\n[Help](https://info.arxiv.org/help) | [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)\n\n\nAll fields\nTitle\nAuthor\nAbstract\nComments\nJournal reference\nACM classification\nMSC classification\nReport number\narXiv identifier\nDOI\nORCID\narXiv author ID\nHelp pages\nFull text\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n[![arXiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logomark-small-white.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)\n[![Cornell University Logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nopen search\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\nopen navigation menu\n\nquick links\n-----------\n\n* [Login](https://arxiv.org/login)\n* [Help Pages](https://info.arxiv.org/help)\n* [About](https://info.arxiv.org/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer Science > Computational Complexity\n===========================================\n\n\n**arXiv:2301.00074v1** (cs)\n\n\n[Submitted on 30 Dec 2022]\n\nTitle:Matrix Multiplication: Verifying Strong Uniquely Solvable Puzzles\n=======================================================================\n\nAuthors:[Matthew Anderson](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Anderson,+M), [Zongliang Ji](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Ji,+Z), [Anthony Yang Xu](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Xu,+A+Y) View a PDF of the paper titled Matrix Multiplication: Verifying Strong Uniquely Solvable Puzzles, by Matthew Anderson and 1 other authors\n[View PDF](/pdf/2301.00074v1)\n> Abstract:Cohn and Umans proposed a framework for developing fast matrix multiplication algorithms based on the embedding computation in certain groups algebras.

We develop and implement constraint-based algorithms build on reductions to $\\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\\mathrm{IP}$ to verify that puzzles are strong USPs, and to search for large strong USPs. We produce tight bounds on the maximum size of a strong USP for width $k \\le 5$, construct puzzles of small width that are larger than previous work, and improve the upper bounds on strong USP size for $k \\le 12$. Although our work only deals with puzzles of small-constant width, the strong USPs we find imply matrix multiplication algorithms that run in $O(n^\\omega)$ time with exponent $\\omega \\le 2.66$. While our algorithms do not beat the fastest algorithms, our work provides evidence and, perhaps, a path to finding families of strong USPs that imply matrix multiplication algorithms that are more efficient than those currently known.\n\n\n| Comments: | 35 pages, 7 figures, full version of SAT 2020 extended abstract |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Symbolic Computation (cs.SC) |\n| ACM classes: | F.2.1; I.2.8; G.4; I.3.2 |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2301.00074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00074) [cs.CC] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:2301.00074v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00074v1) [cs.CC] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.00074>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Matthew Anderson [[view email](/show-email/fdde1ba8/2301.00074)]   \n **[v1]**\nFri, 30 Dec 2022 23:53:51 UTC (2,427 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-----------...\nStep 2 (DataAnalyst - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'ScienceDirect Life Science domain Reference Works 2022':\n\n1.
