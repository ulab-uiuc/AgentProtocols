Eligible Hong Kong residents include those who have arrived in the United States since August 2021, as well as those who were covered under the initial decision. This extension provides Hong Kong residents who are concerned about returning to Hong Kong with temporary safe haven in the United States. We will issue a Federal Register notice as soon as possible to implement the president’s announcement. DED is in the president’s discretion to authorize as part of his constitutional power to conduct foreign relations. Although DED is not a specific immigration status, individuals covered by DED are not subject to removal from the United States, usually for a designated period of time.
