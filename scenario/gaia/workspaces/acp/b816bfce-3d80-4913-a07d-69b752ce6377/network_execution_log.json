Teacher in a rural school is a key figure in the training, development and education of children. From his profession, qualification, ability to work with a small but different age student population is entirely dependent and learning outcomes of students. Therefore, the educational activities of teachers of small schools should be analyzed and monitored not only for assessing his work, but with the aim to provide all possible assistance in the specific conditions of ungraded schools.\n\n\n| Comments: | *the structure of the article is wrong* |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Computers and Society (cs.CY) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1406.7515](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7515) [cs.CY] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1406.7515v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7515v2) [cs.CY] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1406.7515>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: Nurassyl Kerimbayev [[view email](/show-email/960aa934/1406.7515)]   \n **[[v1]](/abs/1406.7515v1)**\nSun, 29 Jun 2014 15:34:37 UTC (252 KB)  \n\n**[v2]**\nWed, 30 Nov 2016 01:58:42 UTC (1 KB) *(withdrawn)*  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text...\n\nPrevious Steps Context:\nStep 1 (JournalResearcher - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Emily Midkiff June 2014 article journal Hreidmar's sons':\n\n1.

This article uses the notation and terminology of the first article and assumes its results. In particular, we refer to an $\\ell$-group with truncation as a truncated $\\ell$-group, or simply a trunc, and denote the category of truncs with truncation morphisms by $\\mathbf{AT}$. Here we develop the analog for $\\mathbf{AT}$ of Madden's pointfree representation for $\\mathbf{W}$, the category of archimed...\n\n3.
