There are at least two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. Firstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which are included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories.

There are at least two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. Firstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which are included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories.

The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which are included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories. Implications and limitations of the analysis are discussed\n\n\n| Subjects: | Digital Libraries (cs.DL) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1212.6773](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6773) [cs.DL] |\n|  | (or  [arXiv:1212.6773v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6773v1) [cs.DL] for this version) |\n|  | <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1212.6773>  Focus to learn more    arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n| Journal reference: | Journal of the Operational Research Society 66, 8, pp. 1370-1384, 2015 |\n| Related DOI: | <https://doi.org/10.1057/jors.2014.113>  Focus to learn more   DOI(s) linking to related resources |\n\n\n\n\nSubmission history\n------------------\n\nFrom: John Mingers [[view email](/show-email/facd9e18/1212.6773)]   \n **[v1]**\nSun, 30 Dec 2012 20:35:06 UTC (435 KB)  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFull-text links:\n\nAccess Paper:\n-------...\n\nPrevious Steps Context:\nStep 1 (WebNavigator - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Nature journal Scientific Reports 2012 conference proceedings':\n\n1.

There are at least two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. Firstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour.
