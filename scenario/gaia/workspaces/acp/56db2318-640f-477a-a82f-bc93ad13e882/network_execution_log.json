We will look for patterns or consistent results across the dataset. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify Consistent Solutions**: We will identify which combinations of weight and transposed columns appear most frequently across the dataset. This will help us determine the most likely correct solutions.\n\n2. **Validate Consistency**: Ensure that the identified solutions are consistent with the checksum calculation for all numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to process the results and identify the most consistent solutions.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"
