The 2016 article discusses transitions between \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical\" societies. The June 2022 paper, titled \"Best of Both Worlds Model Selection,\" does not directly relate to AI regulation or contain a relevant figure with axes labeled with societal terms. Therefore, the word \"hierarchical\" from the 2016 article is the one that describes a type of society and could potentially be a label in the AI regulation paper's figure, if such a figure exists.",
