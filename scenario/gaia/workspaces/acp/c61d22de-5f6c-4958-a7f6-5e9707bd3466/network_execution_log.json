Our ap-\nproach requires that each base learner comes with a candidat e regret bound that\nmay or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base l earner according\nto a schedule that keeps the base learner’s candidate regret bounds balanced until\nthey are detected to violate their guarantees. We develop ca reful mis-speciﬁcation\ntests speciﬁcally designed to blend the above model selecti on criterion with the\nability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the e nvironment. We recover\nthe model selection guarantees of the CORRAL [ Agarwal et al. ,2017 ] algorithm\nfor adversarial environments, but with the additional bene ﬁt of achieving high\nprobability regret bounds, speciﬁcally in the case of neste d adversarial linear ban-\ndits. More importantly, our model selection results also ho ld simultaneously in\nstochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are t he ﬁrst theoretical re-\nsults that achieve best of both world (stochastic and advers arial) guarantees while\nperforming model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n1 Introduction\nA fundamental challenge in sequential decision-making is t he ability of the learning agent to adapt\nto the unknown properties of the environment they interact w ith. While adversarial environments\nmay require some caution, we would also like to leverage situ ations where more benign scenarios\nmay be disclosed as a result of this interaction.\nIn the literature on multi-arme...<truncated>"

Our approach requires that each base learner comes with a candidate regret bound that may or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base learner according to a schedule that keeps the base learner's candidate regret bounds balanced until they are detected to violate their guarantees.

Our ap-\nproach requires that each base learner comes with a candidat e regret bound that\nmay or may not hold, while our meta algorithm plays each base l earner according\nto a schedule that keeps the base learner’s candidate regret bounds balanced until\nthey are detected to violate their guarantees. We develop ca reful mis-speciﬁcation\ntests speciﬁcally designed to blend the above model selecti on criterion with the\nability to leverage the (potentially benign) nature of the e nvironment. We recover\nthe model selection guarantees of the CORRAL [ Agarwal et al. ,2017 ] algorithm\nfor adversarial environments, but with the additional bene ﬁt of achieving high\nprobability regret bounds, speciﬁcally in the case of neste d adversarial linear ban-\ndits. More importantly, our model selection results also ho ld simultaneously in\nstochastic environments under gap assumptions. These are t he ﬁrst theoretical re-\nsults that achieve best of both world (stochastic and advers arial) guarantees while\nperforming model selection in (linear) bandit scenarios.\n1 Introduction\nA fundamental challenge in sequential decision-making is t he ability of the learning agent to adapt\nto the unknown properties of the environment they interact w ith. While adversarial environments\nmay require some caution, we would also like to leverage situ ations where more benign scenarios\nmay be disclosed as a result of this interaction.\nIn the literature on multi-arme...<truncated>"
