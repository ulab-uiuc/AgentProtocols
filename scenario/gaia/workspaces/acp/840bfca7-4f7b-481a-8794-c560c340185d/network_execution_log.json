Itâs a phenomenon we enjoy here on Earth and we can, to a varying degree of success predict its appearance. Now a team of scientists are learning how to predict when these spectacular light shows will happen on Mars too. It's a breakthrough that could one day help protect future astronauts on the red planet while also helping us to understand these beautiful displays work in alien skies.
