That means the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the non-governmental body responsible for naming astronomical objects, has its work cut out for them. Recently they tackled a relatively easy challenge by approving a series of names on the asteroid Donaldjohnson, the first and only target of NASA‚Äôs Lucy mission in the main asteroid belt. With those names come a whole new way to talk about one of the asteroids that humanity has studied most closely thus far.\n* [![This Trio Of Robots Could Explore Lunar Caves](/article_images/Low-Res_AerialSkylightRobots_20250912_150629.jpg)](/articles/this-trio-of-robots-could-explore-lunar-caves)\n  ### [This Trio Of Robots Could Explore Lunar Caves](/articles/this-trio-of-robots-could-explore-lunar-caves)\n  \n  By [Evan Gough](/authors/ion23drive) - September 12, 2025\n  \n  Seeking refuge in caves is natural. Animals do it, and so did our ancestors. Future lunar astronauts may do the same when they visit the Moon. Lunar caves can provide protection from the harsh radiation that bathes the Moon, the wild temperature swings on its surface, and from meteorites that can damage spacesuits and equipment. But these caves need to be explored first, and new research outlines how a team of three diverse robots working together could do the job.\n* [![A Bi-Directional Plasma Thruster Could Deorbit Space Junk Safely](/article_images/Low-Res_Picture1_20250910_112857.png)](/articles/a-bi-directional-plasma-thruster-could-d...\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è  REMEMBER: All your work must contribute to answering the ORIGINAL TASK above!"
