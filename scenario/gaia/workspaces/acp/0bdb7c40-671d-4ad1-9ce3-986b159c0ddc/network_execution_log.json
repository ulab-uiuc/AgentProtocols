The APOD image features Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Alan Bean from the Apollo 12 mission. \n\nTo proceed, I need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which Alan Bean belonged, as he is the smaller astronaut in the image. Then, I will identify the astronaut from that group who spent the least time in space.\n\nLet's start by finding out which NASA Astronaut Group Alan Bean was a part of.

The APOD image features Charles \"Pete\" Conrad and Alan Bean from the Apollo 12 mission. \n\nTo proceed, I need to determine the NASA Astronaut Group to which Alan Bean belonged, as he is the smaller astronaut in the image. Then, I will identify the astronaut from that group who spent the least time in space.\n\nLet's start by finding out which NASA Astronaut Group Alan Bean was a part of. I will perform a web search to gather this information.\nStep 3 (SpaceTimeAnalyzer - success): Tool result: Observed output of cmd `browser_use` executed:\nSearch Results:\nSearch results for 'Alan Bean NASA Astronaut Group':\n\n1.
