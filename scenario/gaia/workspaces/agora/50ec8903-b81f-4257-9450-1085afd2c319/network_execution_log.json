Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the information provided and the logical deductions we can make:\n\n1. **Cube Structure**:\n   - A standard Rubik's cube has 6 faces, each with a distinct color.\n   - There are 6 center cubes (one per face), 12 edge cubes (each with two colors), and 8 corner cubes (each with three colors).\n\n2. **Given Conditions**:\n   - All blue cubes have been found.\n   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube.\n   - All green corner cubes have been found.\n   - All green cubes that border yellow have been found.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face‚Äôs cubes have been found.\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - Identify the two colors on the missing edge cube.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Blue Cubes**: Since all blue cubes are found, the missing cube cannot have blue as one of its colors.\n- **Orange Cubes**: All cubes around the orange center and their opposites are found, so the missing cube cannot be directly adjacent to the orange center or its opposite.\n- **Green Cubes**: All green corners and green cubes bordering yellow are found, so the missing cube cannot be a green corner or a green-yellow edge.\n\n### Deduction\n\nGiven these conditions, we need to identify which two-colored edge cube is missing. The possible colors on a Rubik's cube are typically red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and white. Since blue is ruled out, and the missing cube is not adjacent to the orange center or its opposite, we need to consider the remaining possibilities.\n\nLet's proceed with a logical deduction to identify the missing cube. I'll use a Python script to simulate the conditions and find the missing edge cube."
