Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Extract the numbers**: Remove hyphens and convert the numbers into a list of digits.\n2. **Identify possible weights**: The weight alternates between 1 and another integer less than 10.\n3. **Check for transposed columns**: Since the transposed columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns, we will focus on columns 3 to 11 (0-indexed).\n4. **Calculate checksum**: For each possible weight and transposed column pair, calculate the checksum and verify if it matches the last digit.\n5. **Output potential solutions**: List all combinations of weight and transposed columns that result in a valid checksum.\n\nLet's start by writing a Python script to perform these steps. We'll use the `sandbox_python_execute` tool to execute the script.\n\nPrevious Steps Context:\nStep 1 (DataPreprocessor - success): To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct weight and the transposed columns in the given numbers.
