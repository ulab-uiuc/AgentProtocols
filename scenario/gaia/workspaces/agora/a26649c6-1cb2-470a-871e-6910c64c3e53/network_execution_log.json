Let's denote this population as `P_wiki`.\n\n2. **Nature.com Population (2020):**\n   - Assume the Nature.com article provided a population estimate for chinstrap penguins in 2020. This population is denoted as `P_nature`.\n   - The article likely provided the number of breeding pairs, so the total population would be `2 * breeding_pairs`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Difference:**\n   - The absolute difference in population is `|P_wiki - P_nature|`.\n\n4. **Convert to Tens of Thousands:**\n   - Divide the absolute difference by 10,000 to convert it to tens of thousands.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer would be the result of the above calculation.\n\nSince the exact population numbers were not retrieved, the final answer cannot be provided.

However, due to the failure in retrieving the necessary data from the sandbox execution, I will provide a logical approach to solve this problem based on the information that should have been obtained.\n\n1. **Wikipedia Population (2018):**\n   - Assume the Wikipedia page provided a population estimate for chinstrap penguins as of the end of 2018. Let's denote this population as `P_wiki`.\n\n2. **Nature.com Population (2020):**\n   - Assume the Nature.com article provided a population estimate for chinstrap penguins in 2020. This population is denoted as `P_nature`.\n   - The article likely provided the number of breeding pairs, so the total population would be `2 * breeding_pairs`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Difference:**\n   - The absolute difference in population is `|P_wiki - P_nature|`.\n\n4. **Convert to Tens of Thousands:**\n   - Divide the absolute difference by 10,000 to convert it to tens of thousands.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The final answer would be the result of the above calculation.\n\nSince the exact population numbers were not retrieved, the final answer cannot be provided. However, this methodology outlines the steps needed to calculate the required difference once the data is available.\n\n**Note:** If the data becomes available, simply plug in the values for `P_wiki` and `P_nature` into the formula to get the final answer."
