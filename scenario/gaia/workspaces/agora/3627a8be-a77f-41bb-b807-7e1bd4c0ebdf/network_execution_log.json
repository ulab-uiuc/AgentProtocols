ImageNet-A/O allow researchers to focus in on the blind spots remaining in ImageNet. ImageNet-R was specifically created with the intention of tracking robust representation as the representations are no longer simply natural but include artistic, and other renditions. The CAOS suite is built off of CARLA simulator which allows for the inclusion of anomalous objects and can create reproducible synthetic environment and scenes for testing robustness. All of the datasets were created for testing robustness and measuring p...\n\n2.
