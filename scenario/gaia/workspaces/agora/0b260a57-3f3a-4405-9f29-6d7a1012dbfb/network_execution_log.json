In subsequent work with Kleinberg and Szegedy, they connected this to the search for combinatorial objects called strong uniquely solvable puzzles (strong USPs). We begin a systematic computer-aided search for these objects. We develop and implement constraint-based algorithms build on reductions to $\\mathrm{SAT}$ and $\\mathrm{IP}$ to verify that puzzles are strong USPs, and to se...\n\n2.
