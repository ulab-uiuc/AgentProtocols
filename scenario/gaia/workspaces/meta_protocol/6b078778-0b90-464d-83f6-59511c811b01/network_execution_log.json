Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara was consecrated as a bishop, but the search results do not provide specific information about the consecrators or co-consecrators involved in his consecration.\n\nHowever, based on historical records, Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara himself never became pope. Therefore, if he was involved in the consecration of another bishop, he would be the one who never became pope. Unfortunately, without specific details on the consecrators or co-consecrators from the search results, a definitive answer cannot be provided. The information available only confirms that Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara did not become pope."

Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara was consecrated as a bishop, but the search results do not provide specific information about the consecrators or co-consecrators involved in his consecration.\n\nHowever, based on historical records, Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara himself never became pope. Therefore, if he was involved in the consecration of another bishop, he would be the one who never became pope. Unfortunately, without specific details on the consecrators or co-consecrators from the search results, a definitive answer cannot be provided. The information available only confirms that Fernando Ni√±o de Guevara did not become pope."
