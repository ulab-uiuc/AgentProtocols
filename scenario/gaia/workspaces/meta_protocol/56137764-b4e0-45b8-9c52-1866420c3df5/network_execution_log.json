Additionally, the content fetched from the OpenCV GitHub repository does not provide a list of contributors or any specific names related to the Mask-RCNN model support.\n\nTo solve this task, one would typically need to access the commit history or release notes of the OpenCV version in question, which might list contributors. However, this information is not available in the current data.\n\nRegarding former Chinese heads of government, some notable names include Zhou Enlai, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Wen Jiabao, and Li Keqiang. Without a list of contributors, it is impossible to match these names to any OpenCV contributors.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine which OpenCV contributor shares a name with a former Chinese head of government. Further access to specific OpenCV version release notes or commit history would be required to make this determination."

Additionally, the content fetched from the OpenCV GitHub repository does not provide a list of contributors or any specific names related to the Mask-RCNN model support.\n\nTo solve this task, one would typically need to access the commit history or release notes of the OpenCV version in question, which might list contributors. However, this information is not available in the current data.\n\nRegarding former Chinese heads of government, some notable names include Zhou Enlai, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Wen Jiabao, and Li Keqiang. Without a list of contributors, it is impossible to match these names to any OpenCV contributors.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it is not possible to determine which OpenCV contributor shares a name with a former Chinese head of government. Further access to specific OpenCV version release notes or commit history would be required to make this determination."
