However, the search results did not provide the necessary information, and it was recommended to access ScienceDirect directly for relevant articles or reports.\n\nSince the required data was not found in the search results, and no specific statistical data was available from the sources accessed, it is not possible to calculate or provide the difference in sample standard deviations to three decimal places. To obtain this information, one would need to directly access ScienceDirect and search for studies or reports that specifically analyze the number of Reference Works and their statistical properties in these fields for the year 2022. Alternatively, consulting with a librarian or researcher with access to ScienceDirect might be necessary to find the required data."
