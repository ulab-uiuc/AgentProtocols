Instead, it points to a different article titled \"The Dead Pony: A Critical Analysis ‚Äî or Scenes from an 8th Grade English Class\" by Jonathan Loring in the \"Steinbeck Review\".\n\nTherefore, I cannot verify the quoted text against the original article by Greetham because the content fetched does not match the citation provided. The correct article needs to be accessed to perform an accurate verification."
