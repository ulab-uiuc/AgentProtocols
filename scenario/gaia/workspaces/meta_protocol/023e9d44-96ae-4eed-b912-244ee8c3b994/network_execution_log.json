Enjoy your trip and happy recycling!\n\nPrevious Steps Context:\nStep 1 (DistanceCalculator - success): Observed output of cmd `create_chat_completion` executed:\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Distance:**\n   - **I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati:** Approximately 2,200 miles.\n   - **I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta (Maine):** Approximately 1,000 miles.\n   - **Total Distance:** 2,200 + 1,000 = 3,200 miles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Water Bottles Consumed:**\n   - You drink 5 bottles for every 100 miles.\n   - Total miles = 3,200.\n   - Number of 100-mile segments = 3,200 / 100 = 32.\n   - Total bottles = 32 * 5 = 160 bottles.\n\n3. **Calculate the Refund Amount:**\n   - According to Wikipedia, the typical refund value for recycling a bottle is $0.05.\n   - Total refund = 160 bottles * $0.05 = $8.00.\n\nTherefore, you will get back $8.00 from recycling the water bottles at the end of your trip.\nStep 2 (BottleCalculator - success): Observed output of cmd `create_chat_completion` executed:\nBased on the calculations provided, you will receive $8.00 from recycling the water bottles at the end of your trip from California to Maine. This is calculated by consuming 160 water bottles over a 3,200-mile journey, with each bottle having a refund value of $0.05 according to typical recycling refund rates.

You consume 5 water bottles for every 100 miles, resulting in a total of 160 water bottles for the entire journey.\n\nAccording to the California Redemption Value (CRV) and typical container deposit legislation in the United States, the refund value for recycling a bottle is generally $0.05. Therefore, by recycling 160 water bottles, you will receive a total refund of $8.00.\n\nThis calculation assumes that the refund value is consistent across the states you travel through, which is a reasonable assumption given the widespread adoption of similar container deposit schemes in the U.S. Enjoy your trip and happy recycling!"
