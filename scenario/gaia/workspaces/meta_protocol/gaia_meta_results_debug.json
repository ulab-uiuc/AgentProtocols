The AI regulation paper titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\" features three axes: Standardization vs. Localization, Utilitarianism vs. Egalitarianism, and Consequential vs. Deontological. The Physics and Society article titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\" discusses egalitarian societies. The common word used in both papers is \"Egalitarianism.\"",

The process followed by the AI system was excellent. The agents effectively communicated and used tools to search for and extract relevant information from the specified arXiv papers. The AI system correctly identified the relevant axes from the AI regulation paper and matched the term 'Egalitarianism' with the discussion of egalitarian societies in the Physics and Society article. The inter-agent communication was clear, complete, and correct, with efficient tool use and appropriate sharing of intermediate results.
