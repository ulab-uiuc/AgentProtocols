A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\n\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced [\"A Common Protocol for Languages\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol), a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol ‚Äî this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" [(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).\n\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor. On top of that, the editor has a slick feel to it.\n\nIn this release, we're rolling out language servers for Python (2, 3 and Django), C, C++, and ReasonML.

Naturally, I was increasingly preoccupied with the code editor. While we‚Äôve considered creating a code editor that meets our needs, the complexity involved in developing one, the richness of open-source choices available, and the size of our staff made it a fruitless rabbit hole to enter. Our time is best spent elsewhere. I have had ...<truncated>"

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\n\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced [\"A Common Protocol for Languages\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol), a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol ‚Äî this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" [(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).\n\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they're bundled with the editor. On top of that, the editor has a slick feel to it.\n\nIn this release, we're rolling out language servers for Python (2, 3 and Django), C, C++, and ReasonML. And soon we'll be adding support for more languages -- Java and Ruby are looking to be next in line.\n\nLet's run through some of the features:\n\n### Autocomplete and signatures\n\n![autocomplete and signatures](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F5a2acaa7d4eef3794b9b2faa99b9ea03df26a0ce-1000x750.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\nautocomplete and signatures\n\n### Jump to definition\n\n![jump to definition](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F86715301014d898ba080a9e49e7054dde86b5e0f-1000x812.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\njump to definition\n\n### Find references\n\n![find references](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F74680409bd7b9751fba51ae45b71609b6ef277b7-1000x810.gif&w=3840&q=75)\n\nfind references\n\n### Refactor\n\n![refractor](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F66219f51a3a225eb4caf9b3593a4101c...<truncated>"
