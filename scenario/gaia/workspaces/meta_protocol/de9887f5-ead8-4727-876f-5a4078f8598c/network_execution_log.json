Curt Fiedler's 2002 paper. However, due to the inability to access the specific content of these papers, the exact lengths of the harlequin shrimp and the sea star are not available.\n\nWithout these specific measurements, it is impossible to perform the calculation directly. The recommended approach is to access these papers through academic databases, libraries, or by contacting the authors or institutions involved. Once the lengths are obtained, the percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Length of Sea Star}}{\\text{Total Length of Harlequin Shrimp}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis formula will provide the integer-rounded percentage of the sea star's length relative to the shrimp's total length.

In this work, we conduct the first systematic exploration of applying test-time scaling methods to language agents and investigate the extent to which it improves their effectiveness. Specifically, we explore different test-time scaling strategies, including: (1) parallel sampling algorithms; (2) sequential revision strategies; (3) verifiers and merging methods; (4)strategies for diversifying rollouts. We carefully analyze and ablate the impact of different design strategies on applying test-time scaling on language agents, and have follow findings: 1. Scaling test time compute could improve the performance of agents. 2. Knowing when to reflect is important for agents. 3.

Curt Fiedler's 2002 paper. However, due to the inability to access the specific content of these papers, the exact lengths of the harlequin shrimp and the sea star are not available.\n\nWithout these specific measurements, it is impossible to perform the calculation directly. The recommended approach is to access these papers through academic databases, libraries, or by contacting the authors or institutions involved. Once the lengths are obtained, the percentage can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Length of Sea Star}}{\\text{Total Length of Harlequin Shrimp}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis formula will provide the integer-rounded percentage of the sea star's length relative to the shrimp's total length.
