Article Authors Metrics Comments Media Coverage Reader Comments Figures Figures Abstract Viruses infecting wild flora may have a significant negative impact on nearby crops, and vice-versa . Only limited information is available on wild species able to host economically important viruses that infect sweetpotatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ). In this study, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV; Carlavirus , Betaflexiviridae) and Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV; Crinivirus , Closteroviridae) were surveyed in wild plants of family Convolvulaceae (genera Astripomoea , Ipomoea , Hewittia and Lep...\n\n3.

Here's How to Fix It. ‚Üê Back to all engineering blogs TL;DR Stop wrestling with low-level search and crawl tools. Gensee provides a high-level Search Agent that handles the entire complex workflow√¢¬Ä¬îsearching, crawling, error handling, and extraction√¢¬Ä¬îin a single API call. It's the difference between managing raw network packets and using a simple socket. Higher Abstraction Focus on your agent's core logic, not search plumbing. Increased Reliability Internal error handling means your agent won't stall. Better Results Get direct answers, not just links and snippets. If you're building an AI agent with web access, you've probably spent more time than you'd like debugging your search tool. Your agent stalls on a bad link, a crawler fails on a JavaScript-heavy page, or an LLM call returns useless information from a snippet. This isn't just frustrating; it's a fundamental flaw in how we equip agents to access web data.
