However, the exhibition itself was not specifically themed around the Chinese zodiac animals, but rather explored the impact of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and art.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the visibility of hands in representations of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac within this exhibition, it is not possible to determine how many of these animals had a hand visible. The exhibition's focus was broader and not centered on the zodiac animals in a way that would provide this specific detail.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude how many of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac had a hand visible in the 2015 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."
