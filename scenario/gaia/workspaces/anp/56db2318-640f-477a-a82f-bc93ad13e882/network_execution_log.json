Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.\n\n978-354181391-9\n978-946669746-1\n978-398036139-6\n978-447656680-4\n978-279586664-7\n978-595073693-3\n978-976647652-6\n978-591178125-5\n978-728465924-5\n978-414825155-9\n================================================================================\nStep 7 - Current Task Input:\nTool result: Observed output of cmd `sandbox_python_execute` executed:\nError: Sandbox execution failed after 4 attempts: Sandbox not initialized\n\nPrevious Steps Context:\nStep 1 (DataPreprocessor - success): To solve this problem, we need to identify the unknown weight and the transposed columns in the given numbers. The process involves:\n\n1. **Extracting the digits**: We need to remove the hyphens and extract the digits from each number.\n2. **Iterating over possible weights**: Since the weight alternates between 1 and another integer less than 10, we will test each possible weight from 2 to 9.\n3. **Checking for transposed columns**: We will check each pair of adjacent columns (excluding the first three and the last one) to see if transposing them results in a valid checksum.\n4. **Calculating the checksum**: For each configuration, calculate the checksum using the alterna...<truncated>"
