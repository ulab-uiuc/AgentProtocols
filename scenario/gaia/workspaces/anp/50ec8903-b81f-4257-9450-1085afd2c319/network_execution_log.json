Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. **Rubik's Cube Structure:**\n   - A standard Rubik's cube has 6 faces, each with a distinct color.\n   - There are 6 center cubes (one per face), 12 edge cubes (each with two colors), and 8 corner cubes (each with three colors).\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - All blue cubes have been found.\n   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube.\n   - All green corner cubes have been found, along with all green cubes that border yellow.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face‚Äôs cubes have been found.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Identify the missing cube, which is an edge cube with two colors.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - Since all blue cubes have been found, the missing cube cannot have blue as one of its colors.\n   - All cubes around the orange center have been found, so the missing cube cannot be adjacent to the orange center.\n   - All green corner cubes and green cubes bordering yellow have been found, so the missing cube cannot be a green-yellow edge.\n   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face‚Äôs cubes have been found, which means the missing cube cannot be on the opposite face of any found orange cube.\n\n5. **Possible Edge Cubes:**\n   - The possible edge cubes are: (White-Red, White-Blue, White-Green, White-Orange, Red-Blue, Red-Green, Red-Orange, Blue-Green, Blue-Orange, Green-Orange, Green-Yellow, Yellow-Red, Yellow-Blue, Yellow-Green, Yellow-Orange).\n\n6. **Process of Elimination:**\n   - Eliminate edge cubes with blue.\n   - Eliminate edge cubes adjacent to the orange center.\n   - Eliminate green-yellow edges.\n   - Eliminate edges on the opposite face of any found orange cube.\n\nLet's apply these conditions to identify the missing edge cube."
