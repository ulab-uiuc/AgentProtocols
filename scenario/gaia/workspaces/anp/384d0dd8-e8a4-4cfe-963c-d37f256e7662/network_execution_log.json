About the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection Nearly 3,000 small molecular entities have been approved for clinical use by U.S., European Union, Japanese, Australian and Canadian authorities and also are suitable for high-throughput screening. Of these, we currently have 2,900 as part of our screening collection.
