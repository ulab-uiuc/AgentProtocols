In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that all identified standards from the 1959 document have been updated or replaced by newer versions over the years, as indicated by the available documents and updates from the USDA and other relevant sources.\n\n**FINAL ANSWER: 100%**",

Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested. ## Methodology The research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings. --- ## Findings ### 1. \\*\\*Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris\\*\\* The USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* in the United States befor...",

The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.",

Research in this field, therefore, is an interdis -\nciplinary endeavor that often involves researchers from the humanities as well as \nfrom computer science. This collaboration influences the methods applied as well as the theories underlying and informing research within those different fields. These implications need to be addressed according to the traditions of different humanities’ disciplines. Therefore, the edition addresses all humanities disci -\nplines in which digital methods are employed. Digital Humanities Research fur -\nthers publications from all those disciplines addressing the methodological and theoretical implications of the application of digital research in the humanities. The series is edited by Silke Schwandt, Anne Baillot, Andreas Fickers, Tobias Hodel and Peter Stadler.\nLise Jaillant has a background in publishing history and digital humanities. She is an \nexpert on issues of Open Access and privacy with a focus on archives of digital infor -\nmation. She was the first researcher to access the emails of the writer Ian McEwan at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas. Her work has been recognised by a British Acade -\nmy Rising Star award. She is currently leading two externally-funded international networks on artificial intelligence applied to digital archives: the UK/Irish network AURA (www.aura-network.net) and the UK/US network AEOLIAN (www.aeolian-network.net).

The bank loan is a financial liability for Lanni.  Lanni's IOU is the bank's financial  asset. The cash Lanni receives is a financial asset.  The new financial asset created is  Lanni's promissory note held by the bank.   b. The cash paid by Lanni is the transfer of a financial asset to the software developer.  In  return, Lanni gets a real asset, the completed software.  No financial assets are created  or destroyed. Cash is simply transferred from one firm to another .  c. Lanni sells the software, which is a real asset, to Microsoft. In exchange Lanni  receives a financial asset, 5,000 shares of Microsoft stock.

Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as ‘the single most influential piece of anti-war literature’ of the Vietnam War period.\nSince then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand – and change – our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky ‘may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today’.\nThis book revisits ‘The Responsibility of Intellectuals’ half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky’s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today’s world.

Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as ‘the single most influential piece of anti-war literature’ of the Vietnam War period.\nSince then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand – and change – our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky ‘may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today’.\nThis book revisits ‘The Responsibility of Intellectuals’ half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky’s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today’s world. Nicholas Allott, Chris Knight, Milan Rai and Neil Smith have studied and written about Chomsky’s thought for many years, while Craig Murray and Jackie Walker describe the personal price they have paid for speaking out. The book finishes with Chomsky’s recollections of the background to the original publication of his essay, followed by extensive commentary from him on its 50th anniversary.\n\n| Type: | Book |\n| --- | --- |\n| Title: | The Responsibility of Intellectuals: Reflections by Noam Chomsky and others after 50 years |\n| ISBN-13: | 9781787355514 |\n| Open access status: | An open access version is available from UCL Discovery |\n| DOI: | [10.14324/111.9781787355514](https://doi.org/10.14324/111.9781787355514) |\n| Publish...",

Federico Lauria's dissertation titled \"The Logic of the Liver\" is the source of the footnote 397.\n2. The Smithsonian American Art Museum has two paintings whose titles are derived from this work.\n\nHowever, the specific chapter numbers or titles of these paintings have not been identified in the previous steps. To find the absolute difference between the chapter numbers, we need to:\n- Identify the titles of the two paintings in the Smithsonian collection that are sourced from Lauria's dissertation.\n- Determine the chapter numbers associated with these titles.\n\nSince the previous attempts to access the Smithsonian's collection or Lauria's dissertation for specific chapter information were unsuccessful, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Access the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Collection:**\n   - Search for paintings in the collection with titles that match or are derived from Lauria's dissertation.\n\n2. **Review Lauria's Dissertation:**\n   - Access the dissertation to identify the chapters and their titles.\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Difference:**\n   - Once the chapter numbers are identified, calculate the absolute difference between them.\n\nGiven the limitations of the previous steps, further direct access to the Smithsonian's collection or Lauria's dissertation might be necessary to complete this task. If these resources are not accessible online, contacting the museum or accessing academic databases might be required.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: The absolute difference between the chapter numbers cannot be determined with the current information.

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",

The sense of guilt is indeed a trace that leads deep into the individual’s mental life, into his childhood life, and into the prehistory of culture and religion. In this book this trace is followed and thus Freud’s thought on the sense of guilt as a central issue in his work is analyzed, from the earliest studies on the moral and “guilty” characters of the hysterics, via the later complex differentiations in the concept of the sense of guilt, unto the analyses of civilization’s discontents and Jewish sense of guilt. The sense of guilt is a key issue in Freudian psychoanalysis, not only in relation to other key concepts in psychoanalytic theory, but also in relation to debates with others, such as Carl Gustav Jung or Melanie Klein, Freud was engaged in.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n\n\n![open access](/images/access/open_access.png)\n\n* [![PDF icon](/images/pdf.png)\n  Download Full Book](/pub/258/oa_monograph/book/24372/pdf)\n\n\n\n\n### Cover\n\n\n\n### Title Page, Copyright\n\npp. 1-4\n\n\n### Contents\n\npp. v-viii\n\n\n### Introduction\n\npp. ix-xii\n\n\n### Chapter 1.

The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?",

However, based on prior knowledge of the Babylonian numeral system, we can interpret these symbols as follows:\n\n1. The symbol 𒐜 represents the number 60 in the Babylonian system.\n2. The combination of symbols 𒐐𒐚 represents the number 12.\n\nThe Babylonian number system is a base-60 system, so the value of the number represented by these symbols is calculated as:\n\n- 𒐜 (60) is in the first position, so it is 60^1 * 60 = 3600.\n- 𒐐𒐚 (12) is in the second position, so it is 60^0 * 12 = 12.\n\nAdding these values together gives us the final decimal number:\n\n3600 + 12 = 3612.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 3612",

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesi...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15763v1:\n\n [2007.15763v1] A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[Skip to main content](#content)\n\n[![Cornell University](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, [member institutions](https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html), and all contributors.\n[Donate](https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html)\n\n\n[![arxiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-one-color-white.svg)](/) > [math](/list/math/recent) > arXiv:2007.15763v1\n\n\n[Help](https://info.arxiv.org/help) | [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)\n\n\nAll fields\nTitle\nAuthor\nAbstract\nComments\nJournal reference\nACM classification\nMSC classification\nReport number\narXiv identifier\nDOI\nORCID\narXiv author ID\nHelp pages\nFull text\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n[![arXiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logomark-small-white.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)\n[![Cornell University Logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nopen search\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\nopen navigation menu\n\nquick links\n-----------\n\n* [Login](https://arxiv.org/login)\n* [Help Pages](https://info.arxiv.org/help)\n* [About](https://info.arxiv.org/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics > Numerical Analysis\n================================\n\n\n**arXiv:2007.15763v1** (math)\n\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2020]\n\nTitle:A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n==================================================================================================\n\nAuthors:[Jeremy Hoskins](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Hoskins,+J), [Vladimir Rokhlin](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Rokhlin,+V) View a PDF of the paper titled A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential, by Jeremy Hoskins and Vladimir Rokhlin\n[View PDF](/pdf/2007.15763v1)\n> Abstract:In the present paper we describe a simple black box algorithm for efficiently and accurately solving scattering problems related to the scattering of time-harmonic waves from radially-symmetric potentials in two dimensions. The method uses FFTs to convert the problem into a set of decoupled second-kind Fredholm integral equations for the Fourier coefficients of the scattered field. Each of these integral equations are solved using scattering matrices, which exploit certain low-rank properties of the integral operators associated with the integral equations.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesi...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15763v1:\n\n [2007.15763v1] A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[Skip to main content](#content)\n\n[![Cornell University](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, [member institutions](https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html), and all contributors.\n[Donate](https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html)\n\n\n[![arxiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-one-color-white.svg)](/) > [math](/list/math/recent) > arXiv:2007.15763v1\n\n\n[Help](https://info.arxiv.org/help) | [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)\n\n\nAll fields\nTitle\nAuthor\nAbstract\nComments\nJournal reference\nACM classification\nMSC classification\nReport number\narXiv identifier\nDOI\nORCID\narXiv author ID\nHelp pages\nFull text\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n[![arXiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logomark-small-white.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)\n[![Cornell University Logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nopen search\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\nopen navigation menu\n\nquick links\n-----------\n\n* [Login](https://arxiv.org/login)\n* [Help Pages](https://info.arxiv.org/help)\n* [About](https://info.arxiv.org/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics > Numerical Analysis\n================================\n\n\n**arXiv:2007.15763v1** (math)\n\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2020]\n\nTitle:A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n==================================================================================================\n\nAuthors:[Jeremy Hoskins](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Hoskins,+J), [Vladimir Rokhlin](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Rokhlin,+V) View a PDF of the paper titled A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential, by Jeremy Hoskins and Vladimir Rokhlin\n[View PDF](/pdf/2007.15763v1)\n> Abstract:In the present paper we describe a simple black box algorithm for efficiently and accurately solving scattering problems related to the scattering of time-harmonic waves from radially-symmetric potentials in two dimensions.

      "question": "Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.\n\nYou have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that all identified standards from the 1959 document have been updated or replaced by newer versions over the years, as indicated by the available documents and updates from the USDA and other relevant sources.\n\n**FINAL ANSWER: 100%**",

Its popularity as a pet has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive when released into nonnative environments. This report investigates the nonnative sightings of \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* in the United States before 2020, as documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The findings are presented in the form of five-digit zip codes, as requested. ## Methodology The research process involved analyzing data from the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and other credible sources. The focus was on identifying specific locations where \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* was reported as a nonnative species before 2020. The data was cross-referenced with geographic identifiers to extract zip codes. Additionally, the reliability and relevance of the sources were evaluated to ensure the accuracy of the findings. --- ## Findings ### 1. \\*\\*Nonnative Sightings of Amphiprion ocellaris\\*\\* The USGS NAS database documented a single confirmed nonnative sighting of \\*Amphiprion ocellaris\\* in the United States befor...",

Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge.

Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence , the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration.

Research in this field, therefore, is an interdis -\nciplinary endeavor that often involves researchers from the humanities as well as \nfrom computer science. This collaboration influences the methods applied as well as the theories underlying and informing research within those different fields. These implications need to be addressed according to the traditions of different humanities’ disciplines. Therefore, the edition addresses all humanities disci -\nplines in which digital methods are employed. Digital Humanities Research fur -\nthers publications from all those disciplines addressing the methodological and theoretical implications of the application of digital research in the humanities. The series is edited by Silke Schwandt, Anne Baillot, Andreas Fickers, Tobias Hodel and Peter Stadler.\nLise Jaillant has a background in publishing history and digital humanities. She is an \nexpert on issues of Open Access and privacy with a focus on archives of digital infor -\nmation. She was the first researcher to access the emails of the writer Ian McEwan at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas. Her work has been recognised by a British Acade -\nmy Rising Star award. She is currently leading two externally-funded international networks on artificial intelligence applied to digital archives: the UK/Irish network AURA (www.aura-network.net) and the UK/US network AEOLIAN (www.aeolian-network.net).

Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as ‘the single most influential piece of anti-war literature’ of the Vietnam War period.\nSince then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand – and change – our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky ‘may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today’.\nThis book revisits ‘The Responsibility of Intellectuals’ half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky’s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today’s world.

Privilege, he argues, brings with it the responsibility to tell the truth and expose lies, but our intellectual culture only pays lip-service to this ideal. The essay has been described as ‘the single most influential piece of anti-war literature’ of the Vietnam War period.\nSince then, Chomsky has continued to equip a growing international audience with the facts and arguments needed to understand – and change – our world. According to The New York Times, Chomsky ‘may be the most widely read American voice on foreign policy on the planet today’.\nThis book revisits ‘The Responsibility of Intellectuals’ half a century on. It includes six new essays written to celebrate Chomsky’s famous intervention and explore its relevance in today’s world. Nicholas Allott, Chris Knight, Milan Rai and Neil Smith have studied and written about Chomsky’s thought for many years, while Craig Murray and Jackie Walker describe the personal price they have paid for speaking out. The book finishes with Chomsky’s recollections of the background to the original publication of his essay, followed by extensive commentary from him on its 50th anniversary.\n\n| Type: | Book |\n| --- | --- |\n| Title: | The Responsibility of Intellectuals: Reflections by Noam Chomsky and others after 50 years |\n| ISBN-13: | 9781787355514 |\n| Open access status: | An open access version is available from UCL Discovery |\n| DOI: | [10.14324/111.9781787355514](https://doi.org/10.14324/111.9781787355514) |\n| Publish...",

Federico Lauria's dissertation titled \"The Logic of the Liver\" is the source of the footnote 397.\n2. The Smithsonian American Art Museum has two paintings whose titles are derived from this work.\n\nHowever, the specific chapter numbers or titles of these paintings have not been identified in the previous steps. To find the absolute difference between the chapter numbers, we need to:\n- Identify the titles of the two paintings in the Smithsonian collection that are sourced from Lauria's dissertation.\n- Determine the chapter numbers associated with these titles.\n\nSince the previous attempts to access the Smithsonian's collection or Lauria's dissertation for specific chapter information were unsuccessful, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Access the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Collection:**\n   - Search for paintings in the collection with titles that match or are derived from Lauria's dissertation.\n\n2. **Review Lauria's Dissertation:**\n   - Access the dissertation to identify the chapters and their titles.\n\n3. **Calculate the Absolute Difference:**\n   - Once the chapter numbers are identified, calculate the absolute difference between them.\n\nGiven the limitations of the previous steps, further direct access to the Smithsonian's collection or Lauria's dissertation might be necessary to complete this task. If these resources are not accessible online, contacting the museum or accessing academic databases might be required.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: The absolute difference between the chapter numbers cannot be determined with the current information.

The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",

The sense of guilt is indeed a trace that leads deep into the individual’s mental life, into his childhood life, and into the prehistory of culture and religion. In this book this trace is followed and thus Freud’s thought on the sense of guilt as a central issue in his work is analyzed, from the earliest studies on the moral and “guilty” characters of the hysterics, via the later complex differentiations in the concept of the sense of guilt, unto the analyses of civilization’s discontents and Jewish sense of guilt. The sense of guilt is a key issue in Freudian psychoanalysis, not only in relation to other key concepts in psychoanalytic theory, but also in relation to debates with others, such as Carl Gustav Jung or Melanie Klein, Freud was engaged in.\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n\n\n![open access](/images/access/open_access.png)\n\n* [![PDF icon](/images/pdf.png)\n  Download Full Book](/pub/258/oa_monograph/book/24372/pdf)\n\n\n\n\n### Cover\n\n\n\n### Title Page, Copyright\n\npp. 1-4\n\n\n### Contents\n\npp. v-viii\n\n\n### Introduction\n\npp. ix-xii\n\n\n### Chapter 1.

In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesi...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15763v1:\n\n [2007.15763v1] A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[Skip to main content](#content)\n\n[![Cornell University](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, [member institutions](https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html), and all contributors.\n[Donate](https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html)\n\n\n[![arxiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-one-color-white.svg)](/) > [math](/list/math/recent) > arXiv:2007.15763v1\n\n\n[Help](https://info.arxiv.org/help) | [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)\n\n\nAll fields\nTitle\nAuthor\nAbstract\nComments\nJournal reference\nACM classification\nMSC classification\nReport number\narXiv identifier\nDOI\nORCID\narXiv author ID\nHelp pages\nFull text\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n[![arXiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logomark-small-white.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)\n[![Cornell University Logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nopen search\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\nopen navigation menu\n\nquick links\n-----------\n\n* [Login](https://arxiv.org/login)\n* [Help Pages](https://info.arxiv.org/help)\n* [About](https://info.arxiv.org/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics > Numerical Analysis\n================================\n\n\n**arXiv:2007.15763v1** (math)\n\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2020]\n\nTitle:A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n==================================================================================================\n\nAuthors:[Jeremy Hoskins](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Hoskins,+J), [Vladimir Rokhlin](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Rokhlin,+V) View a PDF of the paper titled A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential, by Jeremy Hoskins and Vladimir Rokhlin\n[View PDF](/pdf/2007.15763v1)\n> Abstract:In the present paper we describe a simple black box algorithm for efficiently and accurately solving scattering problems related to the scattering of time-harmonic waves from radially-symmetric potentials in two dimensions. The method uses FFTs to convert the problem into a set of decoupled second-kind Fredholm integral equations for the Fourier coefficients of the scattered field. Each of these integral equations are solved using scattering matrices, which exploit certain low-rank properties of the integral operators associated with the integral equations.

Researchers around the world are eager to run larger and larger quantum algorithms that promise speedups impossible to any classical algorithm. However, the available quantum computers are still volatile and error-prone. Thus, layout synthesis, which transforms quantum programs to meet these hardware limitations, is a crucial step in the realization of quantum computing. In this paper, we present two synthesizers, one optimal and one approximate but nearly optimal. Although a few optimal approaches to this problem have been published, our optimal synthesi...\n\nMetadata:\n- Total results: 3\n- Language: en\n- Country: us\n\nFetched Content from http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15763v1:\n\n [2007.15763v1] A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[Skip to main content](#content)\n\n[![Cornell University](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Simons Foundation, [member institutions](https://info.arxiv.org/about/ourmembers.html), and all contributors.\n[Donate](https://info.arxiv.org/about/donate.html)\n\n\n[![arxiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logo-one-color-white.svg)](/) > [math](/list/math/recent) > arXiv:2007.15763v1\n\n\n[Help](https://info.arxiv.org/help) | [Advanced Search](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced)\n\n\nAll fields\nTitle\nAuthor\nAbstract\nComments\nJournal reference\nACM classification\nMSC classification\nReport number\narXiv identifier\nDOI\nORCID\narXiv author ID\nHelp pages\nFull text\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n[![arXiv logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/arxiv-logomark-small-white.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)\n[![Cornell University Logo](/static/browse/0.3.4/images/icons/cu/cornell-reduced-white-SMALL.svg)](https://www.cornell.edu/)\nopen search\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\nopen navigation menu\n\nquick links\n-----------\n\n* [Login](https://arxiv.org/login)\n* [Help Pages](https://info.arxiv.org/help)\n* [About](https://info.arxiv.org/about)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics > Numerical Analysis\n================================\n\n\n**arXiv:2007.15763v1** (math)\n\n\n[Submitted on 30 Jul 2020]\n\nTitle:A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential\n==================================================================================================\n\nAuthors:[Jeremy Hoskins](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Hoskins,+J), [Vladimir Rokhlin](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Rokhlin,+V) View a PDF of the paper titled A fast adaptive algorithm for scattering from a two dimensional radially-symmetric potential, by Jeremy Hoskins and Vladimir Rokhlin\n[View PDF](/pdf/2007.15763v1)\n> Abstract:In the present paper we describe a simple black box algorithm for efficiently and accurately solving scattering problems related to the scattering of time-harmonic waves from radially-symmetric potentials in two dimensions.
