Use density as a conversion factor. Density (\\(\\rho\\)) is a physical property found by dividing the mass of an object by its volume. Regardless of the sample size, density is always constant. For example, the density of a pure sample of tungsten is always 19.25 grams per cubic centimeter. This means that whether you have one gram or one kilogram of the sample, the density will never vary. The equation, as we already know, is as follows: \\[\\text{Density}=\\dfrac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}} \\nonumber \\] or just \\[\\rho =\\dfrac{m}{V} \\label{eq2} \\] Based on this equation, it's clear that density can, and does, vary from element to element and substance to substance due to differences in the relationship of mass and volume.

Density can be used as a conversion factor between mass and volume. Contributions & Attributions. 2.9: Density is shared under a CK-12 license¬†...\n   Content: 2.9: Density - Chemistry LibreTexts Skip to main content Learning Objectives Define density. Use density as a conversion factor. Density (\\(\\rho\\)) is a physical property found by dividing the mass of an object by its volume. Regardless of the sample size, density is always constant. For example, the density of a pure sample of tungsten is always 19.25 grams per cubic centimeter. This means that whether you have one gram or one kilogram of the sample, the density will never vary. The equation, as we already know, is as follows: \\[\\text{Density}=\\dfrac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}} \\nonumber \\] or just \\[\\...<truncated>"
